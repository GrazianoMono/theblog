That\u2019s kind of what Sony does at the show most years \u2013 offer a bunch of nuggets about upcoming products, without providing much in the way of details. And hey, if you\u2019ve got something exciting up your sleeve, might as tease it out a bit.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the official PlayStation blog took the next step, revealing <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2022\/02\/22\/first-look-the-headset-design-for-playstation-vr2\/#sf253727454\">a bit more with the product<\/a>. It\u2019s one of those sorts of hardware reveals where a company talks about things like rounded corners vents and how it was inspired to come to all these sorts of design decisions. The main thing, being, however, that we\u2019re finally getting a good look at the thing.<\/p>\n<p>Sony describes the design language as, in a word, \u201corb.\u201d It\u2019s an orb designed to match the orby design of the orbily design n VR2 Sense controller orbs. It\u2019s orbs all the way down, folks. Makes sense. Round is a good shape to settle on for the human hand and heads. Sony adds: \u201cThe circular orb shape represents the 360-degree view that players feel when they enter the virtual reality world.\u201d Orbastic.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2275129\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Comfort\u2019s really the key here, because you\u2019re going to be wearing this thing for a long time. That includes new integrated vents and tweaks to the adjustment dials, adding more options for focal lengths. The system sports a new motor for tactile feedback and a slimmer profile, overall. The weight balance and adjustable headband should prove familiar to PSVR gen. one users. Ditto for the headphone jack placement.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2275132\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2275132\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2275132\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg 2826w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg?resize=768,386 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg?resize=680,342 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg?resize=1536,772 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1029 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-22-at-10.09.57-AM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2275132\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sony<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I started to work on the design for the PlayStation VR2 headset, one of the areas I wanted to focus on first was the idea of creating a vent in the headset to let air out, similar to the vents on the PS5 console that allows airflow,\u201d says Sony designer Yujin Morisaw. \u201cOur engineers came up with this idea as a good way to allow ventilation and avoid having the lens fog up while players are immersed in their VR games. I worked on many design concepts to achieve this, and in the final design, you can see there is a little space in between the top and front surface of the scope that contains the integrated ventilation. I am really proud of how this turned out and the positive feedback I have gotten so far. I hope our PlayStation fans will also agree, and I can\u2019t wait for them to try it out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sony says the following about the black and white design language,<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<blockquote><p>Our goal is to create a headset that will not only become an attractive part of your living room decor, but will also keep you immersed in your game world, to the point where you almost forget you are using a headset or controller. That\u2019s why we paid very close attention to the ergonomics of the headset and conducted extensive testing to ensure a comfortable feel for a variety of head sizes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The thing isn\u2019t going to blend in with the furniture here (unless you live on the Death Star), but maybe you won\u2019t feel the need to stash it away every time you have guests over.<\/p>\n<p>The first PSVR system arrived for the PlayStation 4 back in 2016. By the end of 2019, the company announced that the headset had reached <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sie.com\/en\/corporate\/release\/2020\/200107.html\">five million in sales globally<\/a>. The followup felt like an inevitability, arriving for the PS5 during a time of increased focus on all things VR\/metaverse.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sony dropped a quick reference to its upcoming virtual reality headset back at CES.

Launched in 2021 in New York, Minded provides consumers with access to online psychiatry. Minded is currently available in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas, Illinois and California. The company says the new funding will be used to expand nationwide and introduce innovative psychiatric offerings.<\/p>\n<p>David Ronick, the co-founder and CEO of Minded who previously co-founded fintech unicorn <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/29\/stash-investing\/\">Stash<\/a>, told TechCrunch that as an entrepreneur in the direct-to-consumer digital space, he looks for frustrating customer problems to solve. He noted that he has taken medication for anxiety and insomnia for a decade and that it has been expensive to get care from an expert in psychiatry. He teamed up with Gaspard de Dreuzy, who has expertise in the space from co-founding a telehealth company Pager, and Dr. Chris Dennis, a multi-state licensed psychiatrist.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We founded Minded with the mission of becoming the foremost specialist in mental health medication treatment, fighting the stigma around taking that medication and making it easy and affordable for all,&#8221; Ronick said.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274397\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Minded is available to people 18 and over who have or think they may have anxiety, depression, or insomnia and are interested in medication as part of their treatment. To get started with Minded, consumers complete an online assessment to see if Minded is right for them. Then, they&#8217;ll chat with a psychiatrist or nurse practitioner via video chat to determine which medication is appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Patients don&#8217;t need a prior diagnosis or prescription to use Minded&#8217;s services. The startup&#8217;s mental health experts can evaluate symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia to diagnose conditions and develop an appropriate treatment plan whether a patient is new to medication or already taking it. Once the medication has been prescribed, Minded will either deliver the prescription to the patient or have it sent to an online pharmacy or a physical pharmacy near them. If a patient has questions about their medication or wants to make changes to their treatment, they can chat with their psychiatrist online.<\/p>\n<p>The company notes that patients don&#8217;t need insurance to sign up for Minded. A membership with Minded is $65 per month, plus the cost of medication. Prescriptions may be reimbursable through patients&#8217; insurance plans, but that depends on their provider.<\/p>\n<p>As for the new funding, Ronick says Minded will expand its scope to treat the full spectrum of mental conditions and expand to over 30 states. The startup also plans to double the size of its medical team and continue to develop technology that lets its practitioners focus their time on patients rather than administrative work.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Minded&#8217;s seed round included participation from Streamlined Ventures, Link Ventures, The Tiger Fund, Unicorn Ventures, Trousdale Ventures, Gaingels, SALT Fund, TheFund, and the founders of Care.com, Bolt, Gravity Blanket, RXBAR, and Gilt.com, along with venture debt from WTI.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of the future, Ronick says Minded will introduce innovative treatments as they become available and prove to be safe and effective.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ll offer DNA testing to diagnose and treat with greater precision, and psychedelics for treatment-resistant anxiety and depression,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The field of psychiatry hasn\u2019t changed much in the past twenty years.

In one of the more recent developments, a language learning app called <a href=\"https:\/\/appewa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EWA<\/a> &#8212; which has built a media-based approach to language acquisition, with excerpts from films and TV, and books, to familiarize learners with vocabulary and speaking &#8212; has passed 51 million downloads and picked up 3.5 million monthly active users, and now it has raised $2.7 million in its first outside funding.<\/p>\n<p>EWA &#8212; pronounced &#8220;E-vah&#8221;, says co-founder and CEO Max Korneev &#8212; has been bootstrapped since being founded in 2018, and it&#8217;s been doing well on its own steam, with a current annual revenue run rate of $32.4 million, based on charging people along three tiers of usage. (The &#8220;freemium&#8221; part of the app is a three-day trial, but it also has an extensive presence on other social media channels like TikTok and Instagram, where it is essentially a content creator, with collectively millions of users learning languages informally from its posts. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ewa.english\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EWA English<\/a> alone has more than 5 million followers.)<\/p>\n<p>Korneev said the startup is now turning to outside funding now both to meet the growth demands it&#8217;s now facing as it scales, and also to hire more engineers to build out features that it has long wanted to have in the app, including more social elements, gamification hooks, and a wider set of languages, with the current list spanning English, Spanish, French, German and Italian.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2275065\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The seed round includes participation from Day One Ventures, Elysium and angels, founders and executives from Semrush, Zynga, Niantic and Zynga. And from what we understand, EWA is already working on its Series A, a $30 million round that it will be raising at a $150 million valuation, with Softbank among the VCs talking to the startup. (I&#8217;ve reached out to Softbank for comment; Korneev declined to comment.)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Duolingo, which is now publicly traded with a market cap today of about <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/DUOL?p=DUOL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$3.4 billion<\/a>, has stolen a march on the online language learning market in part by making its app very sticky: users log in daily to keep learning streaks going and to stay at the top of their leagues, and they link up with people on the app that they might also know in the real world, tapping into natural competitiveness and turning that into habitual behavior.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>EWA&#8217;s unique selling point up to now has been how it has harnessed the vast world of online media in aid of its purpose. Users of the app have options to learn by reading well-known books, or excerpts from popular films and TV &#8212; the idea being that their familiarity with plot lines will give them a head start in making out what people are saying. It then bolsters that knowledge with word games.<\/p>\n<p>The approach appealed to me personally because it reminded me of how my family and I learned English when we first came to the U.S. from Russia. (And no, the coincidence that Korneev is also Russian was not lost on me.) Korneev said that this was an intentional choice the company made to try something different and more attuned to our modern times to bring in a different kind of language learner.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;If you look at the self-education apps space, a lot of them copy the dynamics of a classroom, and more specifically old methologies, but these are just not effective anymore,&#8221; he said, pointing out that Duolingo&#8217;s own research has found that on average less than 1% of people ever finish an online language course. &#8220;People want to be entertained. So when we ask our users, why do you use EWA, they answer, because it&#8217;s entertaining. We combine that entertainment with education.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It seems that my family is not the only one that took the &#8220;native media&#8221; approach to learning languages: this was also how Korneev learned different languages while working in IT.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of startups are born out of pain, and this is how EWA started, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I ended up watching films with subtitles and reading books with vocabulary on the side,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw that others were doing this, too, and it was helping them move forward with a language.&#8221; He was taken enough with the idea that he quit his job in IT to see if he could turn his own language learning approach into a business. He teamed up with other co-founders Stepan Nikitin, Anton Aleshkevich, and Stas Morozov, and thus EWA was born.<\/p>\n<p>The startup has a mass of developers based out of Russia but EWA itself is officially based in Singapore &#8212; something that Korneev said was very much intentional because it&#8217;s hard at the moment (understandably) for Russian startups to raise money from western investors. Korneev, in keeping with this moment in time and the Covid pandemic that has changed how many of us work, describes the team as a remote workforce, with he himself splitting time between Singapore, Budapest and Barcelona.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Online language learning continues to be a huge opportunity for startups, with the most engaging experiences meeting a surge of interest from consumers looking for more productivity out of the hours that they spend on their smartphones.

A spokesperson confirmed to the paper that the shift in business was taking place, with supply chain issues and COVID contributing to the change.<\/p>\n<p>Since its inception, the company has been developing its vacuum-tube system to carry both passengers and freight. One of the earliest concepts VH floated was an \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2016-08-16-hyperloop-one-dubai.html\" data-ylk=\"elm:context_link;itc:0\" data-rapid_p=\"19\" data-v9y=\"1\">inland port<\/a>,\u201d in which cargo vessels would put containers onto capsules that are shot inland before they\u2019re processed. That way, the main logistics hub wouldn\u2019t need to be beside the sea, and could instead be at the heart of a transit hub closer to customers.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s something that encouraged DP World, the Dubai-owned ports and logistics giant, to invest in the technology.

It is a unique type of AI-first database using machine learning models outputting vectors, also known as embeddings, hence the name vector search engine, said Bob van Luijt, SeMI\u2019s CEO and co-founder.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274604\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>He explained that vector search engines are not new \u2014 Google Search is an example of a solution built on top of a vector search engine.

But having the models is one thing, using them to power your search and recommendation systems in production is another, and this is exactly what Weaviate solves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since founding the company in 2019 with CTO Etienne Dilocker and COO Micha Verhagen, van Luijt has seen SeMI\u2019s technology inspire over 100 use cases, including startups, like Keenious or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/16\/zencastr-raises-4-6m-as-its-video-offering-goes-live-for-all\/\">Zencastr<\/a>, creating new businesses based on the new possibilities a vector search engine gives them, and uses where the results provided by Weaviate directly help people, for example, in medical.<\/p>\n<p>Some of van Luijt\u2019s personal favorites were ones that he said were more &#8220;esoteric,&#8221; including the vectorization of and search through the human genome, the mapping of the whole world in vectors, or so-called graph embeddings, that can be easily searched through with Weaviate, like a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/semi-technologies\/biggraph-wikidata-search-with-weaviate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demo<\/a> SeMI created on Meta Researches&#8217; graph embeddings.<\/p>\n<p>SeMI raised a $1.2 million seed in August 2020 from Zetta Venture Partners and ING Ventures and since then has been on the radar of venture capital companies. Since then, its software has been downloaded almost 750,000 times, growth of about 30% per month. Van Luijt didn\u2019t give specifics on the company\u2019s growth metrics, but did say the number of downloads can correlate to sales of enterprise licenses and managed services. In addition, the spike in usage and understanding of the added value of Weaviate has caused all growth metrics to go up, and the company to exhaust its seed funding.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Though the seed funding was gone, the company was not actively seeking new funding. However, when the SeMI co-founders entertained conversations with Cortical Ventures, a new fund from ex-Datarobot founders and New Enterprise Associates (NEA), van Luijt said the firms showed them how they would be supporting the business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was truly \u2018pinch my arm jaw-dropping\u2019 awesome,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything they&#8217;ve done in the past, the teams that are supporting us, was exactly what we&#8217;re looking for, and I can say from, although very fresh experience, all the amazing stories are true.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Those conversations led to NEA and Cortical co-leading a new financing round of $16 million in Series A dollars.<\/p>\n<p>SeMI intends to deploy the new funding into hiring U.S. and European talent and doubling down on its open source community for both Weaviate and vector search in general. It will also increase its focus on go-to-market and products around the open-source core, and make first steps on research where machine learning overlaps with computer science.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, van Luijt believes that we are looking at the next wave of database technology that started with the SQL wave that ushered in big winners, like Oracle and Microsoft, followed by a second wave was the no-SQL database wave, with winners like MongoDB and Redis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are now at the brink of a new generation of databases, those who are AI-first, and Weaviate is an example of this,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to educate the market not only about Weaviate but also vector search databases, or AI-first databases for that matter. This is an extremely exciting thing to do because machine learning brings something uniquely awesome to the table. For example, having your database answer natural language questions over millions \u2014 or even billions \u2014 of documents, or \u2018understand\u2019 what millions of photos or video contain.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gZZGIWmz7m\"><p><a

Ostensibly, it also provides the same nutritional benefits as wild-caught fish, without the mercury, micro plastics, and other contaminants that sometimes appear in wild and farmed fish.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274976\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Even better, say Wildtype cofounders Justin Kolbeck and Ary\u00e9 Elfenbein: Wildtype has figured out how to make \u201csushi-grade\u201d salmon by cultivate growing the cells of a Pacific salmon, also known as a Coho salmon, in steel tanks that look like brewery tanks, then putting the cells in so-called scaffolds, which are structures made of plant-derived ingredients, to guide to cells to shape each cut of fish. (Wildtype isn&#8217;t growing fins or heads here, say the founders &#8212; only the kind of cut of salmon you might see behind the sushi bar.)<\/p>\n<p>The two friends\u00a0 \u2013 a former business consultant and a trained cardiologist, respectively \u2013 are so confident in their end product that last year they opened a tasting room just beyond the tanks so that chefs could try the salmon and learn more about its production.<\/p>\n<p>If all goes as planned, those chefs will soon feature Wildtype\u2019s salmon along with their other offerings. So will grocery stores.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s within sight. In December, Wildtype announced distribution agreements with Snowfox, which operates sushi bars at 1,230 grocery locations nationwide, and Pok\u00e9works, which operates 65 fast casual restaurants, and the deals \u201cpave the way for consumers to experience Wildtype\u2019s cultivated salmon once the company\u2019s manufacturing capabilities <a href=\"https:\/\/www.provisioneronline.com\/articles\/111854-wildtype-announces-first-restaurant-and-retail-agreements-with-pokeworks-and-snowfox#:~:text=Wildtype%2C%20a%20startup%20creating%20sushi,over%20100%20stores%20by%202023.\">achieve the required scale<\/a>,\u201d per the announcement.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s getting from A to B that\u2019s the trick right now.<\/p>\n<p>First, getting Wildtype\u2019s salmon to the same price \u2013 or less \u2013 than traditional sushi-grade salmon is still a work in progress, say Kolbeck and Elfenbein.<\/p>\n<p>It also remains to be seen if consumers will embrace cell-grown seafood with the same zeal as plant-based meat. It\u2019s widely known that red meat consumption is associated with an elevated risk for cancer, whereas fewer people are aware of the PCBs, dioxins, and mercury that appear in some salmon because of the food the salmon have ingested. More, strict rules on contaminant levels in feed ingredients are now in place, which have <a href=\"https:\/\/doh.wa.gov\/community-and-environment\/food\/fish\/farmed-salmon\">lowered contaminant levels in these fish<\/a>, making them safe to eat by federal standards.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most notably, Wildtype is still awaiting FDA approval after entering into a consultation process with the agency in 2019; it can\u2019t sell through the restaurants it expects to partner with until it receives this. (As for liability insurance, the company says it has the same liability insurance typically found among meat and seafood producers.)<\/p>\n<p>Still, the company is interesting for a long list of other reasons, including that one of its biggest potential threats, Impossible Foods, has said it was working on plant-based and not cell-grown seafood and it hasn\u2019t released anything yet.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, smaller venture-backed companies in the same industry appear focused on other seafood items. BlueNalu, for example, is trying to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/01\/19\/cell-based-seafood-producer-bluenalu-raises-60-million.html\">cultured mahi mahi<\/a> as its first cultured seafood item, while Gathered Foods is working on single-serve, ready-to-eat pouches of <a href=\"ihttps:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/gathered-foods-makers-of-good-catch-plant-based-seafood-secures-26-35-million-in-b-2-bridge-funding-round-with-louis-dreyfus-company-and-others-301263534.html\">plant-based tuna<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Wildtype\u2019s product could also prove a lot faster and more efficient to use since it grows only the edible parts of the salmon. (Theoretically, chefs would avoid the time and waste traditionally involved in the butchering of a fish.)<\/p>\n<p>Yet another argument that Wildtype makes centers on traceability. Says Elfenbein, \u201cIt\u2019s particularly relevant in the world of seafood where people often order one thing and receive another.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, if the 35-person company is able to scale and sell its salmon at a reasonable price, it&#8217;s easy to see how it makes a dent.<\/p>\n<p>On the scaling front, Wildtype says it can&#8217;t grow the salmon faster, a process that currently takes four to six weeks (we asked). But it can open up new locations, and it can develop a fully automated production system, which it hasn&#8217;t yet done.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the nutrients it feeds the cells, which Elfenbein describes as &#8220;like a fancy Gatorade,&#8221; is &#8220;expensive today because it isn&#8217;t customized for food production methods&#8221; so Wildtype is &#8220;investing heavily in just providing the basic nutrients that cells need to survive.&#8221; But perhaps those costs will come down in time, too.<\/p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t sound daunted by the challenges either way.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end,&#8221; says Kolbeck, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have a very affordable and accessible product. We want to turn [the status quo] on its head, where the most nutritious foods are the most expensive.&#8221; The ultimate goal, he adds is sushi-grade salmon that&#8217;s &#8220;cheaper than a chicken thigh,&#8221; which they see as &#8220;within the realm of possibility.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wildtype last raised funding in late 2019, closing a $12.5 million Series A round from CRV, Maven Ventures, Spark Capital and Root Ventures.

Until now farmers may have had the desire to serve these markets, but the reality of doing it just wasn\u2019t achievable or affordable. If this model works in Iowa there\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t be replicated across the US.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new funding will go toward growing the business, which includes bringing Wallace\u2019s existing regenerative farming business under the umbrella of 99 Counties. It will also be invested in hiring, building out the traceability technology and marketing to provide content to consumers about the farms it is working with.<\/p>\n<p>99 Counties is competing against the likes of Butcher Box and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/crowd-cow\/company_financials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crowd Cow<\/a>, which raised $25 million the past four years, according to Crunchbase.

Average basket costs will be $140.

As a result, the company said users began to listen to Spotify in their car more than before, though the company declined to share any specific metrics to further illustrate this point, when asked. (Arguably, the project had to be at least somewhat successful for Spotify to make the player available to the wider public.)<\/p>\n<p>The company did offer a window into the consumer demand for the product when CEO Daniel Ek said during Spotify&#8217;s Q3 earnings call that it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/roadshow\/news\/spotify-car-things-wait-list-signups-exceed-2-million-people-and-climbing\/\">saw<\/a> over 2 million users sign-up on Car Thing&#8217;s waitlist within a matter of months.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The version of Car Thing that&#8217;s shipping to the public is the same as before, but will soon add some small software updates.

It will also introduce an &#8220;Add to Queue&#8221; voice command which will allow you add music or podcasts to your queue by speaking.

The Premium requirement remains, but the waitlist is being dropped. However, Car Thing is still a U.S.-only product for the time being. (The $89.99 price includes the shipping fees, Spotify says.)<\/p>\n<p>The only other change is to the Car Thing&#8217;s packaging.

communications platform<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, Clickatell became the go-to API interface that allowed companies to send

Clickatell got a capital infusion from Sequoia Capital and other investors for its $12 million Series B round to move beyond customer engagement and add payments into one of its <\/span><span

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a chat commerce space where the likes of Twilio, Zendesk and Stripe power activities in communication platform as a service (CPaaS), contact center as a Service (CCaaS) and e-commerce payments, respectively, Clickatell plays in the intersection of the three and helps businesses deploy payments in chat channels<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:

make purchases, track orders, and resolve issues with a text or chat<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company claims to have developed

desert,\u201d de Villiers said to TechCrunch on the company\u2019s progression from enabling customer engagement via chat to payments<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">had to wait for things like the WhatsApp channel to open up. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And two years ago,

the U.S<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership broadens<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the payments giant\u2019s acceptance of

It is building a platform to tailor-make fats aimed at enhancing the flavor of alternative meats.<\/p>\n<p>The process involves synthetic biology, deep learning and genomics tools that produce fats that are more sustainable than the current oils, like coconut, that are used in plant proteins, but also mimic animal-based analogs in terms of flavor and texture, CEO Yulin Lu told TechCrunch.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274542\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Lu and Chief Scientist Peng Xu founded the California-based company in 2021. Lu comes from a foodtech background, working previously for Impossible Foods and Eat Just scaling up technology platforms to produce commercial products. Peng works in synthetic biology in making lipids in microbial systems.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is clear to me that the product quality and consumer experience has reached a plateau,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe see successful brands in the space of meat, but it is hard to go beyond that. There are so many premium meats people like, and the key missing component is the fat to elevate the quality of the product.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>He explained that nearly all companies use coconut oil for the replacement of fat in plant-based meats. It\u2019s not the same flavor as meat, so food manufacturers have to add flavor additives that lead to not-as-good-for-you ingredient labels. With its technology, Yali Bio aims to create a broader selection of functional fats to \u201cunlock the market, which is limited by quality of product and consumer experience,\u201d Lu added.<\/p>\n<p>Now that it has identified fats as what is needed, the company is working on how to make fats into a product system that is highly efficient. There are different systems and approaches in use currently, including using animal cells or fat tissues.<\/p>\n<p>Yali Bio is instead taking a precision fermentation approach using microbes. It is building a proprietary technology to build up a microbial strain library and test them out. Getting to the next step is to demonstrate the fermentation bioprocess by running the strains in fermentors as part of pilot programs to prove production at a small or intermediate scale.<\/p>\n<p>Those next steps led to the company going after some capital. Lu participated in an accelerator program for the last six months and is in the process of building a new laboratory. The startup raised $3.9 million in seed funding in a round led by Essential Capital, with participation from new and existing investors Third Kind Venture Capital, S2G Ventures, CRCM Ventures, FTW Ventures and First-in Ventures. Stephanie Sher and John Goldsmith also participated as angel investors. The funding brings Yali Bio\u2019s total funding to $5 million to date.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the funding will go toward the lab, but also into the company\u2019s synthetic biology component, product development, identifying business partnerships, marketing and recruitment. The company has seven employees currently and a number of open positions in the area of product, food science and fermentation that should help Yali Bio to be around 12 people by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Mz1ri2dcZL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/06\/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide\/\">Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/06\/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide\/embed\/#?secret=5HSid2oBdl#?secret=Mz1ri2dcZL\" data-secret=\"Mz1ri2dcZL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Though Yali Bio\u2019s technology will take time to get up-and-running, Lu said it is not unlike other approaches. For example, the cell-based approach was in the first wave started over seven years ago, and some are at pilot scale or have limited release in restaurants, like<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/23\/eat-just-the-alt-protein-company-formerly-known-as-hampton-creek-has-raised-another-200-million\/\"> Eat Just<\/a>, or with food makers, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/07\/the-every-co-grabs-175m-as-it-cracks-code-on-animal-free-protein-products\/\">The EVERY Co<\/a>, which is also using precision fermentation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe know what we can do with the existing team and we want to add additional capabilities to take the company from the biotech R&amp;D company to having tangible products,\u201d Lu added. \u201cWe want to demonstrate with precision fermentation that we can get to tangible products and samples much faster compared to other technologies. It depends on the regulatory process, the finished product and the technical complexity, but we think we can do it in two to three years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Edward Shenderovich, managing partner at Essential Capital, said most investors are new to the food alternative space, especially to the world of synthetic biology being applied to food as the technology has matured.<\/p>\n<p>He believes we are at the forefront of a fourth agricultural revolution, where every one previously led to lower costs and increases in product volume and quality. This fourth one is led by bio manufacturing and will be a massive change in supply chains and value creation opportunity for those involved, he added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnything that enables us to move from an animal-based agriculture to an animal-free world using bio manufacturing is a worthy pursuit,\u201d Shenderovich said. \u201cYulin identified an important pain point in the adoption of plant-based, fermented and cultivated food. Most cultivated meat is just proteins, and we like to eat fat. Fat has been demonized, but it is making a comeback.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ERQR8ak8YV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/is-cell-cultured-meat-ready-for-prime-time\/\">Is cell-cultured meat ready for prime time?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

Clearly, there are many factors that influence a building&#8217;s emissions and construction\/thermal properties are just a couple of them.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s material can be used for buildings up to 100m tall, per Leko, which was founded back in 2017 and now has &#8220;multiple&#8221; construction projects ongoing across its home Benelux region currently, including homes, offices and data centers (some ongoing<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lekolabs.com\/projects\">\u00a0projects<\/a> are visible on its website).<\/p>\n<p>As well as engineered wood, Leko says it uses a &#8220;fully circular manufacturing process&#8221; &#8212; and what it bills as an &#8220;automotive style, robotics driven&#8221; approach to construction, with components such as walls prefabricated off-site in its factory and delivered at the point of installation &#8212; which can reduce the time needed for a build vs traditional methods (50% faster builds is the claim).<\/p>\n<p>The company has also developed a software platform to help automate and optimize the building design process, using algorithms which it says it are able to reduce wood usage vs traditional buildings (by up to 50%), as well as ensuring better thermal, acoustic and static properties.<\/p>\n<p>This algorithmic approach also means Leko can resolve the moisture and noise problems that are typically associated with wooden buildings &#8212; or, at least, that&#8217;s the claim.<\/p>\n<p>Fire risk is perhaps a tougher challenge to entirely resolve, given timber is a flammable material. But of course engineered wood would obviously still need to meet building fire safety standards.<\/p>\n<p>Leko says the Series A funding will be used to scale its software and robotics construction system throughout Europe &#8212; including in Germany, the Nordics and the UK, while still supplying finished walls from its factory in Luxembourg.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a key change to its exec team also being announced today &#8212; with former CCO of the air taxi startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/22\/lilium\/\">Lilium<\/a>, Dr Remo Gerber, joining as CEO, with Leko&#8217;s current CEO and founder, Francois Cordier, moving to the CTO role to focus more on product.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9GhuA5YLGA\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/04\/made-of-air-a-maker-of-carbon-negative-thermoplastics-locks-in-5-8m\/\">Made of Air, a maker of &#8216;carbon negative&#8217; thermoplastics, locks in $5.8M<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Made of Air, a maker of &#8216;carbon negative&#8217; thermoplastics, locks in $5.8M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/04\/made-of-air-a-maker-of-carbon-negative-thermoplastics-locks-in-5-8m\/embed\/#?secret=7RabrsfL9h#?secret=9GhuA5YLGA\" data-secret=\"9GhuA5YLGA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zVg8uLoXxt\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/12\/2150-vc-hits-312m-for-fund-to-build-and-run-cities-greener-and-emit-vastly-less-co2\/\">2150 VC hits $312M for fund to build and run cities greener, and emit vastly less CO2<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;2150 VC hits $312M for fund to build and run cities greener, and emit vastly less CO2&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/12\/2150-vc-hits-312m-for-fund-to-build-and-run-cities-greener-and-emit-vastly-less-co2\/embed\/#?secret=CJ1oiVcTd2#?secret=zVg8uLoXxt\" data-secret=\"zVg8uLoXxt\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LDNTj4KsY1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/01\/pina-earth-carbon-credits\/\">Can carbon credits for improving forests help save them &#8212; and us &#8212; from climate change?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Can carbon credits for improving forests help save them &#8212; and us &#8212; from climate change?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/01\/pina-earth-carbon-credits\/embed\/#?secret=xIoZC6r3Pr#?secret=LDNTj4KsY1\" data-secret=\"LDNTj4KsY1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Luxembourg-based Leko Labs, a construction startup that&#8217;s developing sustainable wood-based building materials as an alternative to steel and concrete and applying automation to construction methods, has closed a $21 million Series A round of funding.

Since Bosch&#8217;s semiconductors, like many others, are made of silicon carbide, the manufacturing process requires absolute clarity \u2013 silicon is found in sand and has to be refined before it can be used for manufacturing. This is an incredibly precise process that can be thrown off entirely if even a tiny speck of dust were to land on the chip at the wrong time.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are systematically expanding our manufacturing capacity for semiconductors in Reutlingen,\u201d said Dr. Stefan Hartung, chairman of the board of management of Bosch, in a statement. \u201cThis new investment will not only strengthen our competitive position, but will also benefit our customers and help combat the crisis in the semiconductor supply chain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Reutlingen wafer fabs will produce 6- and 8-inch wafers. 6-inch wafers aren&#8217;t in use as much as 8-inch or 12-inch today, but the process can reduce the production cost of semiconductor products like LEDs and sensors. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/semiconductor-research-organization-semiengineering-8-inch-coco-zhang\/?trk=articles_directory\">There&#8217;s been a shortage of specifically 8-inch wafers<\/a> since 2019, and these have mainly been used in things like sensors, MCUs and wireless communication chips. The expansion of Reutlingen will serve the growing demand for MEMs in the automotive and consumer sectors and for silicon-carbide power semiconductors, says Bosch.<\/p>\n<p>Bosch&#8217;s Dresden facility will produce more 12-inch silicon chips, which are used for manufacturing high performance products like CPUs, logic ICs and memories.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cAI methods combined with connectivity have helped us achieve continuous, data-driven improvement in manufacturing and thereby produce better and better chips,\u201d said Heyn. &#8220;This includes the development of software to enable automated classification of defects. Bosch is also using AI to enhance materials flows. With its high level of automation, this state-of-the art production environment in Reutlingen will safeguard the plant\u2019s future and the jobs of the people working there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bosch is also planning to extend an existing power supply facility, constructing an additional building for media supply systems.

Automata, which got its start making a robotic arm for handling individual tasks, has now raised $50M to automate entire lab processes from start to finish.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/19\/uks-automata-raises-7-4m-for-its-lightweight-industrial-desktop-robot\/\">When we last talked with Automata in 2019<\/a>, the company had just raised a $7.4M A round and was focusing on developing and deploying its Eva robotic arm, which could be used for a variety of common tasks: moving glass around, performing simple samples, that sort of thing. But they soon found that life as a robot provider for small, highly individual projects and labs wasn&#8217;t a viable business model.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not enough to engage with your customer at one stage \u2014 like, &#8216;here&#8217;s the most affordable robot arm on the market, good luck!&#8217; If companies buy one or two robots, it optimizes a few processes but it doesn&#8217;t revolutionize how that company works. So over the last few years we&#8217;ve started looking at how we can drive adoption of our tech at a scale that matters,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Mostafa ElSayed.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274525\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>They identified three large markets that they felt were on the cusp of an automation boom: diagnostics, drug discovery, and synthetic biology (i.e. the discovery and cultivation of purpose-built microbes).<\/p>\n<p>What the company found as it installed the first few hundred of its Eva arms was that companies in these sectors had a lot of &#8220;partial automation.&#8221; ElSayed compared this to having a dishwasher in your kitchen: you don&#8217;t have to wash plates by hand any more, but you still have to load and unload it, add soap, select the settings, etc. Useful but it still relies entirely on human labor.<\/p>\n<p>The limits of partial automation were highlighted during the pandemic, when labs performing PCR tests especially were operating at maximum capacity and still nowhere near meeting demand. Similarly in drug development and synthetic bio, timelines stretch into the 5-7 year range for certain processes because there&#8217;s a hard limit on how frequently a given process can be run. By moving from partial to full automation, huge time savings and throughput increases can be realized. But it couldn&#8217;t be done with a handful of robotic arms.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2275032\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2275032\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2275032\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg\" alt=\"The Automata Labs enclosure with Eva robotic arm next to it.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"595\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg 1744w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg?resize=1536,892 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-eva.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2275032\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Automata Labs enclosure with Eva robotic arm next to it.<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to build an entirely new hardware stack that allows for this kind of automation,&#8221; ElSayed said. Late last year they announced their new hardware platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/automata.tech\/products\/automata-labs\/\">Automata Labs<\/a>, a sort of modular container built for continuous operation of machinery inside and the ability to pass the results to the next step. &#8220;The benchtop is really the standard unit of all laboratories, so it&#8217;s basically a whole lab bench that&#8217;s amenable to automation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s most visible success is an NHS testing facility that has been as automated as is currently possible (that is, humans are still in there but a huge amount of the work is done robotically), and has now processed over a million samples. ElSayed pointed out that the number is large, but the more important one was that the automation reduced turnaround times for results by half, which as you might imagine is crucial for time-sensitive tests. It&#8217;s largely because the automation level lets the clinicians set the robots to work overnight, and they can have results ready in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>In experimental settings, timelines can be reduced by 25-40 percent, which is significant but may sound modest to anyone who has read of orders of magnitude productivity increases in sectors like manufacturing. ElSayed said there are other paths to go down to further improve that specific number, like the &#8220;lights out laboratories&#8221; that enabled the NHS rapid labs.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2275030\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2275030\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2275030\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?w=453\" alt=\"CEO Mostafa ElSayed sits in a chair below the Automata logo.\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/automata-mostafa-elsayed.jpg?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2275030\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CEO Mostafa ElSayed.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>But he noted that for many researchers there&#8217;s also a serious need for accuracy and repeatability.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a clear, describable need for those user bases,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s the basic one of increasing throughput while reducing menial tasks in a lab&#8230; but there was also, and we didn&#8217;t know this going in, a repeatability problem in labs. Teams would publish their own research papers, then try to replicate the results and fail, because the processes in the lab were highly manual and variable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So a large part of the draw in automation is systematic tracking and performance, and fewer errors. To that end Automata has been investing in the software to manage and administer its labware and robots.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The scientists in these organizations \u2014 especially their automation scientists, this up and coming role \u2014 what they really want is the ability to program these systems themselves, and design these screenings themselves, rather than call us in,&#8221; said ElSayed. As anyone who&#8217;s negotiated with scientists before probably knows, many would rather keep doing things the old way rather than cede control to an outside agency. So building a system that&#8217;s designed to be deployed and adjusted by the on-site crew has been a major focus.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;More and more of the labs adopting our hardware are coming to us for these digital solutions to configure or deploy them, or connect the ecosystem to their data system,&#8221; he continued.<\/p>\n<p>A new generation of hardware, in limited testing with partners, is set to be revealed later this year, and Automata is also getting ready to make the leap into the U.S. and wider European markets.

We started a pilot and it is going well,\u201d MarketForce CEO and co-founder Mbaabu told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>During the pilot, Mbaabu said that order stock value tripled, underlining the demand for such tailored inventory financing options for traders who sell a huge chunk of all the FMCGs sold across sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re very deliberate about extending working capital and that&#8217;s why we raised some debt and also because we are looking at that fintech angle as our big frontier for the next phase of our business,\u201d said Mbaabu.<\/p>\n<p>This latest round (equal amount of debt and equity) brings the total funds raised by MarketForce to date to $42.5 million.

A growth in merchant number and RejaReja\u2019s expansion also means new markets for FMCG brands.<\/p>\n<p>RejaReja is an asset-light model meaning that it doesn\u2019t own capital assets like warehouses and delivery trucks as most of them are provided by its partners that include manufacturers and distributors.

This has also opened up distribution opportunities for brands that were not previously able to access these markets,\u201d said Mbaabu.<\/p>\n<p>During an interview in December last year, Mbaabu told TechCrunch that RejaReja expects its merchants to grow to 1 million by the end of this year as it works towards digitizing the estimated 100 million small traders across sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p>\n<p>He also said that since launch, RejaReja had grown exponentially with over 87,000 orders made through the platform at an average basket value of $151. With a 40% month-on-month growth, it expected to record over $60 million in annualized transaction volumes at the end of last year.

It also uses the traders\u2019 transaction history to develop the credit profiles needed to secure loans. The startup has a partnership with Pezesha &#8212; a digital financial marketplace platform &#8212; to extend loans to its merchants.<\/p>\n<p>MarketForce plans more partnerships to bring on board other services for merchants like insurance, savings and investment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe goal of RejaReja is to be the super app of the informal market.

It\u2019s also had exists such as mobile gaming studio, Hutch Games, which sold to MTG for $375M in November 2020.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274968\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>LPs in the fund include firms such as Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (through their Sienna Capital vehicle) and private firms such as Wilshire Associates, alongside 20 family offices and over 20 entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>The question is, with so many early-stage VC funds now playing across Europe, what sets Backed apart from the others?<\/p>\n<p>Backed says it&#8217;s all about being \u201chuman-centric\u201d. That translates into an 18-month founder support programme, with leadership training, workshops, in-house recruiter, mental health service providers and an in-house executive coach for founders and leadership teams.<\/p>\n<p>In other words: a large swathe of training and events. Backed\u2019s other \u2018special sauce\u2019 &#8211; it says &#8211; is plenty of off-sites and founder retreats. Whether you want to describe those as \u2018parties\u2019 or not is up to you, but it\u2019s just as well that, in modern times, UK Prime Minister Boris Johson has re-defined the meaning of the phrase \u2018work events\u2019.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This emphasis on hosting translates into 30 events annually, from founder dinners to a 1,000 person party at the Finnish tech conference Slush, and co-hosting conferences such as Coin-Op, a global blockchain-gaming summit held at the London Science Museum.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Backed also has 60 Venture Scouts in its network across Europe such as Maximillian Bade, GP at Nucleus Capital, Abi Mohamed, Programme Lead at Tech Nation, Saloni Bhojwani, Partner at Pink Salt Ventures, and Nalden, Founder of WeTransfer and Adelee.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview de Haes told me: \u201cDuring the pandemic, we launched three different kinds of workshop or webinar series for founders, such as how do you survive a pandemic and how do you look after your people. Now that we\u2019re moving back to an offline world\u2026 it&#8217;s ramping up again. So this year, for example, we&#8217;ve got two three-day retreats in Italy and Ibiza for founders, six crypto gaming events. So it&#8217;s we&#8217;re going back to a much more in-person experience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The question, however, is how are all these events funded, given VCs aren&#8217;t usually in the events business?: \u201cWe&#8217;re funding from management fee and from voluntary contributions that attendees make up the events,\u201d  de Haes told me. \u201cAnd then from sponsors, so AWS, Pernod Ricard &#8211; these sorts of businesses want to be associated with this clan of people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What next, a Backed &#8216;Fyre Festival&#8217;?<\/p>\n<p><strong>BACKED\u2019S INVESTMENT SECTORS (# OF INVESTMENTS)<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>\u2022   21% Web3 \/ Blockchain\n\n\u2022   15% Gaming &amp; Entertainment\n\n\u2022   12% Biotech\n\n\u2022   10% Financial Services\n\n\u2022   10% Manufacturing\n\n\u2022   6% Beauty \/ Fashion\n\n\u2022   7% Food \/ Agtech\n\n\u2022   6% HR \/ Legal\n\n\u2022   4% Pharmaceuticals\n\n\u2022   4% Property\n\n\u2022   3% Utilities\n\n\u2022   2% Education\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>FOUNDER DEMOGRAPHICS (Observed)<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>\u2022   White male (71.2%) White female (6.3%)\u2028\n\u2022   Black male (1.8%) Black female (4.5%)\u2028\n\u2022   Asian\/NBPOC male (13.5%) Asian\/NBPOC female (2.7%)\u2028\n<\/code><\/pre>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>London-based early-stage European VC fund Backed is bolstering its position by adding \u20ac75M to its Seed fund, while adding another \u20ac75M via a new follow-on fund vehicle.

A signup flow is often the first interaction a prospective customer has with a business, and we are the first to make it easy to create and take them to live \u2013 improving the flow of information and ultimately ensuring prospects can be moved through the funnel in a smarter way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The COVID-19 pandemic created a catalyst to start Upflowy as a remote company from the beginning. In the early stages of 2020, being a remote-first business was a fairly new concept, but the startup has been able to source talent from all over the world, Ang said.

That comes with extra responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis its buyers and, more broadly, society at large. Apple must set reasonable conditions for the use of its services. In that context, it cannot abuse its dominant position. Apple\u2019s conditions will thus have to take into account the interests of buyers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>A spokesperson for the regulator confirmed that Apple hasn\u2019t offered any new proposals since last week&#8217;s were found to be &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/14\/acm-fines-apple-again\/\">unreasonable<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We expect Apple to comply with the order,&#8221;

at very least &#8212; its ability to charge a sizeable commission fees on in-app purchases howsoever it can &#8212; looks instructive in that it foreshadows far bigger battles to come, once the EU (and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all\/\">other jurisdictions<\/a>) adopt (and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/05\/germany-fco-google-decision\/\">enforce<\/a>) tough new ex ante regulations against digital giants, with penalties to match.<\/p>\n<p>Under the EU&#8217;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposal, for example &#8212;

in Apple&#8217;s case &#8212; would mean a fine that&#8217;s closer to \u20ac25BN than \u20ac25M (so certainly harder for Cupertino to shrug off).<\/p>\n<p>Even so, it&#8217;s clear regulators will face a massive task trying to get resource-rich tech giants to dance to their exact tune.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s response to the ACM complaint has shown it&#8217;s not willing to simply abandon a lucrative revenue stream just because a regulator decides it&#8217;s unfair &#8212; and will instead work against that by reconfiguring its operations to find a new way to extract much the same fee&#8230; (Apple said it would charge Dutch dating apps tapping into third party payment tech <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/04\/apple-to-charge-27-fee-for-dutch-dating-apps-using-alternative-payment-options\/\">a 27% fee on sales<\/a> vs the standard 30% App Store commission).<\/p>\n<p>Staying on top of fast-iterating tech giants &#8212;

urging a high level fix for the legal uncertainty now facing scores of US cloud services (or at least those that refuse to give up their own access to people&#8217;s data-in-the-clear).<\/p>\n<p>However the Commission has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/03\/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec\/\">previously warned there will be no &#8216;quick fix&#8217;<\/a> this time &#8212; saying back in 2020 that a replacement would only be possible if all the issues identified by the European Court of Justice in its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism\/\">July ruling which invalidated Privacy Shield<\/a> can be resolved (which means both a legal and accessible means of redress for Europeans and tackling disproportionate US surveillance powers which rely on bulk intercepts of Internet communications).<\/p>\n<p>So, in short, Privacy Shield 3.0 looks like a tall order &#8212;

Which could be a result of pressure from the business side to eke out growth&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/02\/facebook-isnt-growing-anymore\/\">earnings earlier this month<\/a>, Meta reported flat quarter-over-quarter usage for its eponymous app (Facebook) &#8212; and near flat growth for its other apps, which it wraps into a &#8220;family of apps&#8221; moniker, rather than breaking out Instagram, WhatsApp etc usage individually. (Daily active users of this &#8216;other apps&#8217; category rose from 2.81BN in Q3 to 2.82BN in Q4; while monthly active users rose from 3.58BN in Q3 to 23.59BN in Q4; but usage of Facebook itself stayed entirely flat, quarter-over-quarter, at 1.93BN DAUs and 2.91BN MAUs.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The disappointing Q4 results wiped 20% off the company&#8217;s value when they hit &#8212; which could be one reason why Meta&#8217;s growth teams may be seeing what levers they can tweak to drive engagement from existing users.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch was alerted to the Instagram settings change by an tipster who shared screenshots of their account (see pics below) which show the company nudging them to &#8220;set a new value for your daily limit&#8221; &#8212; because, as it puts it, &#8220;the available daily limits are changing as part of an app update&#8221;. (Full marks to Meta for penning a sentence that fails to contain any meaningful explanation of why it&#8217;s making arbitrary changes to limit users&#8217; control.)<\/p>\n<p>This user had previously specified a 10 minute daily limit. However they&#8217;re now suddenly being informed this option is no longer available &#8212; and, presumably, any users who had not yet specified a daily limit or had picked a different (higher) limit would be unlikely to even realize that the 10 minute option had been deprecated.<\/p>\n<p>And while Instagram&#8217;s notification to the user of this change to daily limits <em>does<\/em> state that they can retain their current 10 minute limit, the app uses blatant dark patterns to nag them into changing it &#8212; including by popping up a notification right above the 10 minute limit that&#8217;s indicated on their &#8220;time on Instagram&#8221; settings page, which further instructs: &#8220;This value is no longer supported. Please edit&#8221; &#8212; all of which is clearly designed to make them think they do actually have to switch to a higher limit.<\/p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2274860,2274861\"]<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My choice has gone away, and if I try and change it, my old minimum of 10 minutes triples to 30 minutes as the new minimum,&#8221; the tipster told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>The source, who preferred to remain anonymous, likened this silent switch to &#8220;a tobacco company saying you can limit your packs a day, as it takes away smaller packs&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They don\u2019t force the change but if go into the edit screen as it tells you to, then you have to force quit the app to get out without changing it,&#8221; they added.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve recently seen Facebook\/Meta using a similarly manipulative persistent notification tactic when trying to push a policy update on WhatsApp users in the face of a major T&amp;Cs backlash &#8212; which has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/27\/whatsapp-eu-consumer-protection-probe\/\">led to an (ongoing) consumer protection probe in the EU<\/a>. But the company has a long, ignoble history <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/20\/just-say-no\/\">of this sort of stuff<\/a>. So none of this is surprising. But ofc that doesn&#8217;t make it okay.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s getting harder for companies like Meta to pull the wool, though. Oversight bodies are wising up to dark patterns. See for example &#8212; again in European Union &#8212; lawmakers in the parliament who <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/20\/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking\/\">recently overwhelmingly backed putting explicit restrictions on such manipulative tactics<\/a> into upcoming rules set to apply widely to digital platforms.<\/p>\n<p>So the scope for platforms to profit off of cynically self-serving defaults (or &#8220;available&#8221; settings) looks to be shrinking.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"enookCA62v\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/20\/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking\/\">European parliament backs big limits on tracking ads<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;European parliament backs big limits on tracking ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/20\/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking\/embed\/#?secret=4WmqQ852EW#?secret=enookCA62v\" data-secret=\"enookCA62v\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Our tipster wasn&#8217;t sure exactly when the 10 minute option they had been able to select previously was discontinued &#8212; but they told us the app had been &#8220;nagging for a couple of weeks&#8221; to press them to &#8220;edit&#8221; the setting.<\/p>\n<p>We also checked what we could see ourselves to confirm this change applied more widely than to a single Instagram user &#8212; and found that 30 minutes seems to be the new &#8216;norm&#8217; for app users.<\/p>\n<p>A US-based TechCrunch reporter found the app also only offers them 30 minutes as the lowest available daily limit.<\/p>\n<p>As with the tipster, the top option this user was presented with in the list of available times &#8212; and thus the option they&#8217;re most likely to notice, from a UX design point of view &#8212; was &#8220;3 hours&#8221; (aka 6x 30 minutes).<\/p>\n<p>Another UK-based TCer who checked their app could also only select 30 minutes as the lowest daily limit for the notification on their Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the picture looked different on the Facebook mobile app. There the options offered to a TechCrunch reporter based in France technically included &#8220;0 hours, 0 minutes&#8221; &#8212; although that did not work when selected. However they were able to select a 5 minute limit (rising in 5 minute increments thereafter) so it looks as if the 30 minute minimum may not have been applied to the Facebook mobile app by Meta (yet).<\/p>\n<p>We were also able to confirm that another UK-based Facebook mobile app user could select a 5 minute minimum on that app.<\/p>\n<p>We asked Meta to confirm any changes it has made to the Instagram daily limits setting &#8212; as well as putting a number of other related questions to it &#8212; but at the time of writing the company had not responded.<\/p>\n<p><em>The company finally sent a statement &#8212; around 11 hours after we asked about this; it was a US holiday today but this delay does underline how another of Meta&#8217;s &#8220;global&#8221; platforms remains locked to US-based comms and US-centric decisions &#8212; see the bottom of this post for the statement and our update.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Facebook garnered a lot of press <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/01\/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time\/\">back in 2018<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> when, with concern surging over the impact of social media platforms on teenagers&#8217; mental health &#8212; it <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/new-time-management-tools-on-instagram-and-facebook\">announced<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> it was giving Instagram and Facebook users new &#8220;time management tools&#8221; &#8212; which included the ability to set a (soft) daily time on usage. <\/span>Users would also be able to view a daily average of time spent on the mobile app, based on a week&#8217;s usage.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want the time people spend on Instagram and Facebook to be intentional, positive and inspiring,&#8221; Ameet Ranadive, product management director at Instagram and David Ginsberg, director of research at Facebook, wrote as they introduced the bundle of time management features. &#8220;Our hope is that these tools give people more control over the time they spend on our platforms and also foster conversations between parents and teens about the online habits that are right for them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The feature launch was linked to a wider company push &#8212; starting around 2017 &#8212; when it appeared to engage publicly with<a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2017\/12\/hard-questions-is-spending-time-on-social-media-bad-for-us\/\">\u00a0concerns about the negative impacts of social media<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However Facebook did so by seeking to reframe the narrative by suggesting any problems with usage are incremental and manageable (i.e. rather than existential for its attention-dependent business) &#8212; just so long as the user has &#8220;tools&#8221; to support what it dubbed &#8220;meaningful social interactions&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Hence the flotilla of tweaks and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/facebooks-latest-transparency-tool-doesnt-offer-much-so-we-went-digging\/\">controls<\/a>&#8221; Facebook\/Meta went on to announce &#8212; offering self-serving &#8216;fixes&#8217; to address societal concerns about social media usage, with the aim of preventing users actually stopping the habit entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Of course these controls rarely &#8212; if ever &#8212; <em>actually<\/em> put users in control. Moreover the underlying content ranking algorithms actively undermine user autonomy by optimizing for profit-maximizing &#8216;engagement&#8217; &#8212; as Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, went on to detail in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/05\/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate\/\">hours of detailed testimony to lawmakers last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Instagram daily time limit feature, for example, was a lot more mindfulness theatre than meaningful control right from the get go &#8212; since users just got a notification if\/when they reached their desired daily time, rather than the app taking firmer action like actually locking them out until the next day.<\/p>\n<p>As Haugen has testified, Facebook has demonstrated a systematic unwillingness to give up little slivers of profitability in service of a greater good (aka the welfare of its users\/society) &#8212; up to and including, it now seems, letting Instagram users select a 10 minute soft limit on their usage. Which would allow for fewer ads to be served vs a 30 minute minimum &#8212; which means less profit for Meta&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So the company&#8217;s claim of trying to deliver &#8216;time well spent&#8217; on its platforms looks to have past its sell by date: Another hollow publicity stunt to buy Fb time while its growth teams drum up new UX hacks to keep the eyeballs busy.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">(On the flip side, it&#8217;s interesting to consider the recent popularity of viral word game, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/12\/josh-wardle-interview-wordle\/\">Wordle<\/a>, whose creator suggested it should only be played for three minutes a day when he spoke to the <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-59881512\">BBC<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> last month &#8212; while the app itself hard-limits the game to one puzzle per day.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">In any case, the debate about regulating powerful tech platforms has<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> moved on considerably since 2017 &#8212; with tech giants like Meta now facing the prospect of hard limits on how they can operate, via incoming regulation such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/20\/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking\/\">EU&#8217;s Digital Markets Act. <\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Or the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code\/\">UK&#8217;s Age Appropriate Design Code<\/a> which seeks to safeguard the welfare of children by enforcing strict privacy defaults and standards, and imposing other restrictions such as time limits on when platforms can message child users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So if the secret of your ad-platform&#8217;s growth is dark pattern design and manipulative messaging &#8212; not to mention <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/24\/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court\/\">anti-competitive surveillance<\/a> &#8212; then your investors do, certainly, have reasons for concern.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:\u00a0<\/strong>In the statement responding to our questions, Meta claimed the removal of &#8220;daily limit&#8221; limits that are shorter than 30 minutes is related to the launch of newer time management feature, which it calls &#8220;Take A Break&#8221; &#8212; saying it wanted to avoid sending people multiple notifications at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the statement in full:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have two time management features. Our existing \u2018daily limit\u2019 shows you a notification when you\u2019ve hit your daily limit, but our newest feature \u2018Take A Break\u2019 shows you full-screen reminders to leave the app, and includes 10 minute intervals. We changed the \u2018daily limit\u2019 options to avoid sending people multiple notifications at the same time.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This raises a number of new questions &#8212; such as why Instagram&#8217;s notifications to our tipster, nudging them to set a new (higher) daily time limit than 10 minutes, did not at the very least inform them of (or even link them to!) the existence of the Take A Break feature?<\/p>\n<p>And why a setting that is marketed as providing users with greater control over their Instagram usage should &#8212; in practice &#8212; lead to a user feeling they like have less control, given it keeps nudging them to remove their self-selected time limit without properly informing them of relevant alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, the wider point about shape-shifting, self-serving settings is that ever iterating user controls which require users to track incremental platform updates in full dimension detail do the polar opposite of putting users in control.<\/p>\n<p>Instead the person whose settings have, yet again, being reset or otherwise reconfigured must constantly work to understand the updated &#8216;version&#8217; of control they are now being offered &#8212; at the very least learning to navigate a new menu interface. And if they don&#8217;t do that &#8212; say they feel too tired to do the research required to grok yet another finicky settings change &#8212; they risk being reset back to a lower level of control vs what they may have previously specified.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has infamously used this tactic with privacy settings over its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/10\/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony\/\">long years of user-hostile design choices<\/a> &#8212; notoriously flipping access to content that users had expressly told it should remain limited to being viewable by &#8220;friends only&#8221; (for example) to opening access to make their stuff entirely public on a totally global service.<\/p>\n<p>Damaging, resetting defaults and function-shifting settings are the very bread and butter of dark pattern design.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Take A Break&#8221; slots neatly into this ignoble tradition.<\/p>\n<p>It appears to have been first mentioned by Instagram back in a September 2021 <a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/pausing-instagram-kids\">blog post<\/a> &#8212; when the company wrote that the feature had &#8220;tentatively&#8221; been given that name; and said the idea for it is to enable users to &#8220;put their account on pause and take a moment to consider whether the time they\u2019re spending is meaningful&#8221;. (The blog post did not actually specify what &#8220;Take A Break&#8221; would do. God forbid the company were to actually inform its users in plain English how something works!)<\/p>\n<p>Understanding these ever iterating new features &#8212; or new user control mechanisms, as they really are &#8212; is typically left to the tech press. Which means many publications generate a lot of coverage simply by explaining the nuance.<\/p>\n<p>This is often very helpful to Meta from a PR point of view, given it can routinely expect huge attention to the quotidian detail of incremental feature tweets\/launches &#8212; which works to suck the oxygen out of the room\/detract attention from more meaningful critiques of the platform giant &#8212; like why Zuckerberg continues to have absolute monarchy levels of power over what Meta does via his majority voting shares; or whether <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/feb\/20\/facebook-lets-vigilantes-in-ethiopia-incite-ethnic-killing\">Meta&#8217;s tools are busy right now whipping up another ethnic massacre<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But back to the detail of &#8220;Take A Break&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of a simple setting that notifies users when their app usage hits their self configured limit &#8212; and maybe offers them a single, big red button to &#8216;Close App&#8217; &#8212; Take A Break offers a far more staged and controlled version of the concept of a usage limit. At a glance, this looks mostly intended to quickly convince the user to return to the comfort of passive scrolling in the app, owing to a curated selection of alternative suggestions Meta presents in bolder, darker text (vs only a faint grey text where it suggests they &#8220;take a moment to reset by closing Instagram&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2021\/12\/07\/tech\/instagram-take-a-break\/index.html\">CNN<\/a> covered Take A Break in a video back in December &#8212; and the listed suggestions that appear in its video don&#8217;t seem optimized to actively discourage more content grazing in its app. Far from it. Some indeed may have the opposite effect (&#8220;do something on your to-do list&#8221;, for example, sounds a helluva a lot like work; while &#8220;take a few deep breaths&#8221; sounds like something you could literally spent a few seconds doing and then feel as if that&#8217;s job done, break over and back to scrolling on Instagram&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, as CNN&#8217;s reporter pointed out, the feature&#8217;s 10 minute limit is sneaky. It is not a hard limit on daily usage &#8212; it&#8217;s merely a resetting pop up that ultimately encourages you to close it and go back to the app like every other tedious pop-up that the data industrial adtech complex routinely (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/02\/iab-tcf-gdpr-breaches\/\">and &#8212; at least in Europe &#8212; illegally<\/a>) sicks onto the web.<\/p>\n<p>And if you do take Instagram up on one of the listed &#8220;Take A Break&#8221; suggestions, and actually switch away from the app &#8212; say so you can fire up Spotify to &#8220;listen to your favorite song&#8221; &#8212; Meta wins again because the app&#8217;s break counter resets back to zero! So it&#8217;s not actually a daily 10 minute limit at all!<\/p>\n<p>Really, &#8220;Take A Break&#8221; is a very different, far more manipulative feature than &#8220;Daily Limit&#8221; &#8212; one that looks intended to groom users into feeling as if they&#8217;re taking a break while simultaneously working to minimize how much time they actually stop using the app. A few breaths of &#8216;time out&#8217; or a couple of seconds &#8220;writ[ing] down what you&#8217;re thinking&#8221; &#8212; or even a minute or two listening to a pop song &#8212; is all Meta says your eyeballs need before it serves up the next batch of ads.<\/p>\n<p>Frankly you can&#8217;t reform this level of dark pattern.<\/p>\n<p>The cynicism is so utterly pitch it should have its own event horizon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nn1Ish1NYp\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/04\/on-metas-regulatory-headwinds-and-adtechs-privacy-reckoning\/\">On Meta&#8217;s &#8216;regulatory headwinds&#8217; and adtech&#8217;s privacy reckoning<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;On Meta&#8217;s &#8216;regulatory headwinds&#8217; and adtech&#8217;s privacy reckoning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/04\/on-metas-regulatory-headwinds-and-adtechs-privacy-reckoning\/embed\/#?secret=poODV44YjU#?secret=nn1Ish1NYp\" data-secret=\"nn1Ish1NYp\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3Fhs017iBa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/16\/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls\/\">Facebook knows Instagram harms teens.

The latter is home to startups like Axie Infinity and Yield Guild Games, which have raised millions of dollars in venture capital owing to the adoption of crypto and play-to-earn models.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mix of positives such as a fast-growing population&#8211;the youngest globally&#8211;, solid smartphone penetration, increasing crypto adoption, and negatives like low GDP per capita across board and unemployment makes Africa the next ripe ground for web3.<\/span><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274689\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And a few companies, such as Jambo, are positioning themselves for this next boom. According to James Zhang, its co-founder and CEO, Jambo wants to onboard millions of users to web3 in Africa through its applications. He founded the company with his sister &#8212; both Congo-born Chinese &#8212; in November 2021 after noticing the opportunity to duplicate the success of web3 projects in Southeast Asia across Africa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although users of Axie Infinity and other guilds only earn an income while playing games under a revenue-sharing model, Jambo is taking a two-sided approach by allowing its users to do so when they partake in web2 and web3 activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, users can save their data spend when they use Jambo. Zhang explains that Jambo partners with telecom providers to get an almost 70% discount and sell directly to its users at a 50% discount from the original cost. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our main user acquisition strategies where we want to double every Africans airtime and data,\u201d Zhang said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, Jambo is partnering with social media companies so users can earn tokens (which they can convert to income) while watching their content on its app.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe reason we can do that is via partnerships with these companies as we tokenize a part of their advertising budget and directly provide to the end-user,\u201d he said. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMany web2 incumbents or even web3 are having a $100-200 user acquisition costs so we can lower that by order of magnitude by directly incentivizing the end-user.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last bit is play-to-earn games. There are currently no popularized play-to-earn web3 games from Africa and this is because the infrastructure to create them, which is through Guilds, is lacking. Zhang said Jambo wants to build that infrastructure. Still, unlike well-known guilds whose business models involve taking percentages of profit from its users, his company doesn\u2019t plan to take a cut from its users\u2019 earnings. Instead, Jambo\u2019s revenues would come from web2 models &#8212; charging advertising dollars and commissions from selling airtime and data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274811\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274811\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2274811\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/James-Zhang-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"Jambo\" width=\"680\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/James-Zhang-1.png 1266w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/James-Zhang-1.png?resize=150,106 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/James-Zhang-1.png?resize=300,213 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/James-Zhang-1.png?resize=768,545 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/James-Zhang-1.png?resize=680,482 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/James-Zhang-1.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274811\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">James Zhang (co-founder and CEO, Jambo)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the \u201cweb3 onboarding portal of Africa,\u201d the CEO said Jambo is testing out over 10 play-to-earn games to introduce to its users in the next couple of months. But for a region with little or no understanding of web3 workings, how does Jambo expect its project to take off smoothly?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEducation is at the core of what we do because I think there is no shortcut in Africa. You have to educate the user base before you can even think about monetizing or start to acquire users at the end of the day. This is why we are launching classes with a full curriculum on web3. We plan to launch that in more than five universities in Africa by the end of Q1,\u201d he answered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the start of this year, Jambo has already signed up over 12,000 students across 15 countries (Morocco, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Uganda, Kenya, Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, DR Congo, Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia, Madagascar and South Africa) to take a curated web3 curriculum, both online and offline. The company said this would enable students to explore opportunities in play-to-earn gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Yet, they are similar in setting up a new web3 segment in Africa different from more established platforms such as remittance and crypto exchanges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Zhang, the fundamental distinction is that while customary platforms help Africans save and send money, new upstarts are increasing earning and wealth potentials for users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think in Africa, there is no money to save because there\u2019s 1% super-rich and 99% the same. So for us, we set out with a different methodology, which is to help the everyday person make money,\u201d the chief executive said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis is why every component in our super app is actually to help the everyday person make money from play to earn, to making money from watching videos and saving money on data credits. So ideally, in three to six months, once our app comes online, the everyday person can make $50 a month from playing on Axie Infinity, make another $20 a month from watching videos, and they make another $10 bucks a month from the money they save on data credits. That would be the ideal situation our app can accomplish with every person.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jambo expects to release its beta version by Q2 and go live in Q3. And in a bid to build its super app, the 60-man team spread across sub-Saharan Africa, Santa Clara and Shenzhen raised a party round from investors who have backed prominent web3 companies such as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/16\/avalanche-raises-230-million-from-private-sale-of-avax-tokens\/\">Avalanche<\/a>, Dharma, BlockFi and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/07\/polygon-raises-450m-from-sequoia-capital-india-softbank-and-tiger-global\/\">Polygon<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They include Coinbase Ventures, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Alameda Research, Tiger Global, Delphi Ventures, AllianceDAO, DeFiance Capital, Yield Guild Games and Polygon Studios. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And a couple of angel investors from the web3 ecosystem like Polygon co-founder and CEO Sandeep Nailwal; ex-ParaFi partner Santiago R Santos; Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon; and partner at Delphi Digital Piers Kicks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat WeChat did in China, Jambo will do in Africa.

Launching its first product felt like waiting for regulators to approve a new drug, he added, noting that it took two years and roughly $1 million for Groundfloor to gain Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to operate in its first U.S. state. Today, the company sells securities in 49 of 50 U.S. states and lends capital to real estate projects in 35 states.<\/p>\n<p>Groundfloor underwrites the loans on its platform using an algorithm that assigns each loan a grade based on its risk across six different factors, with an emphasis on the track record and experience of the real estate investor receiving the loan, Dally said. Investors on Groundfloor can then make allocation decisions that are appropriate for their own risk tolerance levels based on these scores, he continued.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Groundfloor has scaled its platform by adding new debt investment products, including a saving and investing app called Stairs that it launched last fall, which now has $22 million in assets invested. On Stairs, users earn between 4% and 6% interest on cash held in what is essentially a checking account. Groundfloor uses the capital it gets from Stairs users to make loans to real estate entrepreneurs, which it holds briefly on its own books before selling them to investors, Dally said. Stairs users have constant liquidity and can take their money out of the app whenever they want, he added &#8212; a novel structure that he said took nine months to qualify with the SEC.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These are heavy RegTech lifts. A lot of legal engineering goes into it. So that process takes a lot takes a long time, but we think it&#8217;s worth it,&#8221; Dally said.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, the company began raising capital from its own users through its own platform and equity crowdfunding platform SeedInvest, totaling $30 million over four public equity raises since then. Individual investors now own about 30% of Groundfloor, Dally said.<\/p>\n<p>The newly-announced Series B comes on the heels of substantial growth for Groundfloor, which saw revenue grow 114% to $12 million in 2021, according to the company. Groundfloor said its investors enjoyed an average return of 10% across all its real estate loans during the year.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274757\" style=\"width: 3310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274757\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2274757 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png\" alt=\"Groundfloor's real estate loan crowdfunding platform\" width=\"3300\" height=\"2475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png 3300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/macbook-pro-mockup-floating-over-a-transparent-background-a11409.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3300px) 100vw, 3300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274757\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Groundfloor&#8217;s real estate loan crowdfunding platform <em><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Groundfloor<\/em><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The latest round brought in a total of $118 million for the company, with $5.8 million in equity coming from Israeli real estate company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.medipowergroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medipower<\/a> and $7.2 million from 3,600+ individual investors who back Groundfloor through crowdfunding platform SeedInvest. 86 individuals also participated in the round directly through the Groundfloor app, with their investment comprising $5.0 in convertible notes. Dally noted that convertible notes are one of the only products on Groundfloor that aren&#8217;t available to non-accredited investors, partially because the company rarely raises them.<\/p>\n<p>Groundfloor announced a strategic partnership with Medipower, which specializes in shopping centers and retail real estate, as part of the funding news. Medipower plans to invest up to $100 million this year in loans on Groundfloor, and up to an additional $220 million next year. The company, which is traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the ticker MDPR, will invest in these loans on the same terms as individual investors on the platform and will be limited in how much it can invest to ensure other investors don&#8217;t get crowded out. As part of the deal, Medipower founder and chairman Yair Goldfinger will join the Groundfloor board.<\/p>\n<p>Medipower&#8217;s investments could amount to 25% of Groundfloor&#8217;s assets under management by the end of 2022, Dally said. He sees the Medipower loan investments as a non-dilutive source of financing because he expects the institutional validation from Medipower investing on Groundfloor to attract revenue for the company from other sources.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That [capital] is going to be directly benefiting real estate entrepreneurs who are doing new construction projects and building housing all over the country,&#8221; Dally said.<\/p>\n<p>Groundfloor plans to use the proceeds from the fundraise, in part, to add 50 new employees to its team, which is currently composed of about 70 people. Around 40% of these new hires will be engineers to support the company&#8217;s growth plans, particularly on the product side, Dally said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting ready to go from 160,000 investors to a million investors in the next couple years,&#8221; Dally said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crowdfunding has become an increasingly popular way for companies to raise capital, and investors are taking notice.

The startup says the round also included founders from European fintechs like Qonto, Viva Wallet, Billie and Scalable.<\/p>\n<p>This brings PayMongo\u2019s total funding to just under $46 million.

Its products include PayMongo API and e-commerce plugins. The new funding will be used to further develop PayMongo\u2019s current payments infrastructure and add more financial services, including disbursements, capital lending, BNPL, and subscriptions and recurring payments.<\/p>\n<p>Part of PayMongo\u2019s product roadmap includes acquiring new licenses that will allow it to operate more financial services. At the same time, the company is also exploring regional expansion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is so much more work to do in the Philippines. We also forecast more than doubling our team size to support this increasing demand and deliver on our aggressive product roadmap. In parallel, we have started some initial exploration and leg work to expand in the SE Asia region, a work we have kicked off last year,\u201d co-founder and CEO Francis Plaza told TechCrunch in an email.<\/p>\n<p>Other digital payment gateways in the Philippines include DragonPay, PesoPay, PayMaya and Paynamics.

Now, one of the bigger players pushing the boundaries of that concept is announcing a big round of funding on the heels of strong demand and what it believes are even bigger opportunities ahead. <a href=\"https:\/\/primarybid.com\/uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PrimaryBid<\/a> &#8212; which helps companies that are going public, or public companies that are raising more money, offer their shares to retail investors (that is, ordinary people, not professionals) alongside more traditional share sales &#8212; has raised $190 million.<\/p>\n<p>Anand Sambasivan, the CEO and co-founder of PrimaryBid, said the London-based startup plans to use the funding both to continue building out the products that it offers to companies, such as the ability to invest in SPAC-based public listings and investments in retail bonds; and to expand to new geographies, specifically with an eye on building out an office in the U.S., where it is going through the process of getting regulatory approvals to work with companies listing in that market and is likely to launch in late 2022 or 2023.<\/p>\n<p>PrimaryBid today interoperates with some 60 channels to enable investments, which include brokerages and apps that people use to make investments today, and that list also is likely to continue growing.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274712\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The company&#8217;s mission is to bring the &#8220;public&#8221; back into the concept of a public offering, giving ordinary people a chance to invest directly in IPOs alongside banks and other large, professional investors,\u00a0Sambasivan said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If public markets were invented today, would they look like they did 100 years ago? No, services would interoperate with APIs, with mobile apps, and more accessible investing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a system in need of an upgrade.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SoftBank, via its Vision Fund 2, is leading this round, a Series C, along with participation from previous, unnamed investors (previous backers in its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/26\/uks-primarybid-raises-50m-as-its-retail-investing-platform-sees-a-covid-19-surge-of-activity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$50 million Series B in October 2020<\/a> included the London Stock Exchange Group, Draper Esprit, OMERS Ventures, Fidelity International Strategic Ventures, ABN AMRO Ventures, Pentech and Outward Ventures).<\/p>\n<p>Sambasivan said that PrimaryBid is not disclosing a valuation, although <a href=\"https:\/\/my.pitchbook.com\/profile\/160946-02\/company\/profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a note on the round in PitchBook<\/a>, from January when it noted $150 million had been secured, pegged the valuation at $650 million. That may have followed from a report on <a href=\"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/500m-british-fintech-star-primarybid-woos-giant-softbank-fund-to-take-stake-12511477\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sky News<\/a> at the time that first floated rumors of the round and put the pre-money valuation at $500 million. If those figures are accurate, PrimaryBid&#8217;s valuation now is around $690 million.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Between that Series B and now, PrimaryBid has been on a growth tear, fueled by an increasing appetite among everyday people to get more involved in the world of investment. The company says that in the past 18 months it has helped facilitate share offerings for retail investors for some 150 IPOs and follow-on share issues. These have been primarily in the U.K., although the company is now also starting to work with companies in France, and &#8212; with the help of its investor ABN AMRO, it is also looking to open for business in The Netherlands. Some of the bigger share sales that it has powered include sales for Deliveroo, PensionBee and the US IPO of MCG Group (Soho House) in 2021, which was done via a share sale in the U.K.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found a foothold in the capital markets in a big way,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;The notion that [we are battling is that] the public is no longer included in the public markets, and some of the best companies going public have a strong ethos of their stakeholders, and they were unable to include that in an IPO. They all see the value of including them in a thoughtful and robust way and we are giving them the ability to do that through our platform.\u00a0Now we are seeing sustained growth and [we believe] what we are doing is too big to fail.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>PrimaryBid is riding on a wave of interest that has been a long time in the forming, helped by a series of other developments. Financial apps like Robinhood and Revolut, and the growth of a new approach to investing popular in Europe, the ETF, have made it much easier for ordinary consumers to invest in public companies and currencies (including cryptocurrencies) that interest them or that they think might bring them good returns &#8212; something that previously would have been only possible for high net-worth individuals working with brokers, or professional investors.<\/p>\n<p>And events like the Gamestop stock frenzy of 2021 may have also highlighted the pitfalls of that democratization, but nevertheless underscored just how powerful general public investing had become. It was only a matter of time before that democratization moved to IPO and follow-on share issues.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">There is a strong argument for B2C companies offering shares to their users as part of a public offering or fundraise, not least because those customers want to back the companies they believe in and already use. That&#8217;s something that will only grow. (Case in point: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/reddit-seeking-more-individual-investors-to-participate-in-its-share-offering-11634589541\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit&#8217;s CEO has stated<\/a> that the company wants to offer shares to individual investors when it goes public.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But Sambasivan points out that consumer-focused businesses are not the only ones that are benefitting from that market demand, either on the part of companies or investors themselves. In fact B2C forms only about 10% of the trades that PrimaryBid has worked with, he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrimaryBid is powering inclusivity in the capital markets by making it simple and easy for anyone to access stock issuances previously reserved for institutional or professional investors,&#8221; said Anthony Doeh, a partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;We believe the team has created a platform that combines technology, data and an \u2018ecosystem friendly\u2019 approach to the challenge of widening participation, including developing a unique Community IPO platform for corporate issuers.

This is something I plan to do on a quarterly basis. I asked 10 investors who actively and frequently back fintech startups a few questions such as what criteria they use when evaluating potential investments and what is the best way to pitch them. I was pleasantly surprised with how forthcoming the investors were. They even shared how you could pitch them, which if you\u2019re a scrappy startup seeking funding, could be very valuable information. I was also struck, and happy, to see that many of these investors are looking outside of the U.S. As expected, Latin America came up multiple times but other regions that investors are eyeing include SE Asia, Europe and Africa. The fact that fintech is becoming such a big deal globally is good news as it also means increased inclusion in many of these regions, so I\u2019m glad investors are taking notice. Crypto, embedded fintech and infrastructure came up several times as areas of interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some other highlights: Index Ventures\u2019 Mark Fiorentino noted that 2021 was the definition of a &#8220;founder\u2019s market&#8221; in fintech. Nikhil Sachdev, managing director at Insight Partners, admits that investors are realizing that the end markets across fintech are massive and, in many cases, \u201csignificantly bigger than we realized.\u201d Christina Melas-Kyriazi of Bain Capital Ventures is excited to see companies build and take advantage of new payment rails and Sheel Mohnot of Better Tomorrow Ventures generously shared an example of a cold email that worked.<\/span><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274649\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of <strong>Better Tomorrow Ventures<\/strong>, the VC firm this week announced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/15\/better-tomorrow-ventures-closes-on-225m-fintech-focused-fund-which-is-triple-the-size-of-its-last-fund\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a new $225 million fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which was triple the size of its last fund.

In a statement, BBVA chairman Carlos Torres Vila said that Neon \u201chas proven to have an offering that is connected to Brazilians\u2019 financial needs, \u201cas its customer acquisition figures demonstrate. In addition, it has the capacity to continue growing quickly, considering how it launches products with such agility in a market with as much potential as Brazil.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also in Brazil, Sao Paulo-based <strong>Trace Finance, <\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which describes itself as \u201ca mix of Brex, Wise with crypto on top,\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/trace-finance-announces-4-3-million-seed-investment-to-disrupt-global-banking-for-latin-american-startups-301482353.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a $4.3 million seed funding round<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The company says it enables faster and more streamlined cross-border banking for LatAm startups. In its pitch, Trace <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said it aims to \u201csignificantly improve\u201d the process for Latin American companies to get financing in the US \u2013 and vice versa.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It added: \u201cThe process for these companies right now is extremely bureaucratic. They typically end up having to open an account with Silicon Valley Bank in the Cayman Islands, pay upwards of 4% in fees, wait over a month, etc. because Latin American banks can be so stringent with capital controls. Trace essentially works with multiple banks, streamlines the onboarding process, and takes care of a lot of the regulatory concerns upfront. The outcome is financing available in 1-2 days (vs. a month) and a fee of 0.2% (vs. 4%). This is something to watch as startup investment in Brazil has grown 93% annually for the past 3 years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>United States<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always fun to see a company I&#8217;ve covered at a very early stage go on to raise more capital in a relatively short amount of time.

The boom was in part thanks to the generous subsidies shelled out by the country&#8217;s food delivery contenders for customers and businesses. As two companies, Meituan and Ele.me, came to dominate the market, they began to raise fees on merchants. But a new regulatory change is about to hobble their profit model.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, a group of Chinese authorities <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ndrc.gov.cn\/xxgk\/zcfb\/tz\/202202\/P020220218522078793799.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> that food delivery platforms should further reduce the service fees charged to restaurants in order to lower the operating costs for food and beverage businesses. The news sent Meituan&#8217;s stock down more than 15% on Friday, erasing over $25 billion in market value. Alibaba, which operates Meituan&#8217;s archrival Ele.me, saw its shares slide about 4%.<\/p>\n<p>The proposal came in a directive led by China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, the country&#8217;s state planner, to &#8220;help struggling service industries recover.&#8221; The new rule <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">will likely taper the profits of the internet behemoths in the long run.

The firm also charges commissions from other types of merchants like hotels, though food delivery remains its largest revenue driver. Food delivery has been one of Alibaba&#8217;s main businesses following the firm&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/27\/alibaba-ele-me-plate-up\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquisition of Ele.me in 2018<\/a>, but e-commerce is still the giant&#8217;s main revenue engine.<\/span><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274691\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>China&#8217;s food delivery platforms have grappled with other changes that could erode their profitability. A viral article from 2020<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/08\/viral-article-puts-brakes-on-chinas-food-delivery-frenzy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> brought to light<\/a> the high-stress environment that put China&#8217;s millions of food delivery workers in danger. Efficiency-optimizing algorithms that don&#8217;t fully factor in human capacity and road incidents mean riders are often running the light to complete assignments.<\/p>\n<p>Chinese authorities have ordered food delivery platforms to improve the safety of their workers. Meituan and Alibaba began giving riders connected helmets that come with voice command functions, so drivers won&#8217;t need to check their phones while dashing down the street on their scooters. The platforms have also relaxed delivery time limits for riders. The challenge for Meituan and Ele.me is how to balance workers&#8217; well-being and business profitability.<\/p>\n<p>Meituan is already working to reduce its reliance on manual labor. It<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/29\/meituan-food-drone-delivery-china\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> recently showcased<\/a> a fleet of food delivery drones that have been running small-scale trials in several Chinese cities. The flyer is in its early stage of product iteration and regulations for low-altitude drones are still taking shape in China. The economic viability of drone-enabled food delivery is also unproven. But automation is at least one way for labor-intensive, on-demand services providers like Meituan to test out a safer, more cost-saving future.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Om7y3GWwbd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/08\/viral-article-puts-brakes-on-chinas-food-delivery-frenzy\/\">Viral article puts the brakes on China&#8217;s food delivery frenzy<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Viral article puts the brakes on China&#8217;s food delivery frenzy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/08\/viral-article-puts-brakes-on-chinas-food-delivery-frenzy\/embed\/#?secret=2aOtPVzRtk#?secret=Om7y3GWwbd\" data-secret=\"Om7y3GWwbd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Between 2016 and 2020, the number of people who ordered food online in China doubled to 400 million.

The system is based on the Privacy Sandbox initiative for Chrome, but isn&#8217;t going live anytime soon. Instead, Google says its current system will remain active for at least two more years while it runs tests.<\/p>\n<p>Google &#8212; which makes a majority of its revenue from advertising let&#8217;s not forget &#8212; is going in a different direction than Apple did. Google even took a bit of a swipe at Apple when announcing the news, noting that <em>&#8220;other platforms have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers.&#8221;<\/em> It says this sort of approach is &#8220;ineffective&#8221; and leads to &#8220;worse outcomes&#8221; for user privacy and developers. Google then touted its system as one where it will work with the industry and developer community to balance the need for user privacy with businesses&#8217; needs. (Not to mention Google&#8217;s own.)<\/p>\n<p>The system, broadly, will involve phasing out the Advertising ID tracking feature, while still allowing advertisers to show personalized ads to groups of users with similar interests. This is based on Google&#8217;s work developing &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/25\/google-kills-off-floc-replaces-it-with-topics\/\">Topics<\/a>,&#8221; which offers users more control and transparency over the ads they see. It will also offer some level of attribution reporting to advertisers and a developer SDK. (A technical run-through <a href=\"https:\/\/mobiledevmemo.com\/rip-gaid-privacy-sandbox-is-coming-to-android-heres-a-summary-of-the-tech\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is here<\/a>.) Already, the system has support from Snap, Rovio, Activision Blizzard, Duolingo and others.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s decision to engage in dialogue, rather than rolling out a policy change that disrupts the existing ecosystem, makes sense for the company because so many Android apps are free and ad-supported, compared with apps on iOS. Plus, Android serves as a gateway to serve ads, which benefits Google&#8217;s bottom line. In addition, Google pointed out that Apple&#8217;s approach can lead advertisers to turn to other, less visible means of tracking users which is bad for users, too. In fact, it says this is already happening, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.lockdownprivacy.com\/2021\/09\/22\/study-effectiveness-of-apples-app-tracking-transparency.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointing to a study<\/a> by ex-Apple engineers that backed up this opinion. The study showed how trackers built features to circumvent Apple&#8217;s ATT rules, making ATT something that only gives the illusion of privacy in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>But critics <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gadgets\/2022\/02\/androids-toothless-privacy-sandbox-fails-to-answer-ios-tracking-limits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have slammed Google&#8217;s plans as &#8220;toothless,<\/a>&#8221; as an optional system for advertisers, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/2\/16\/22937297\/android-privacy-sandbox-google-apple-facebook-ad-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">others noted that Google<\/a> can&#8217;t even really do anything to prevent its competitors from running &#8220;effective ads on Android&#8221; since it&#8217;s already facing antitrust accusations of being an ad monopolist &#8212; which limits its ability to change things in this space. Then there&#8217;s the fact that Google&#8217;s announcement was more of a plan to create a plan (after much discussion) than it was any sort of definitive step forward. In the end, there isn&#8217;t much detail as to how all this works because there just aren&#8217;t details yet &#8212; they&#8217;re TBD. Meanwhile, Android user privacy remains unimpacted.<\/p>\n<h3>Crypto apps&#8217; Super Bowl ads paid off<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274069\" style=\"width: 1928px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274069\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2274069 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1918\" height=\"1110\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png 1918w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png?resize=150,87 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png?resize=300,174 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png?resize=768,444 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png?resize=680,394 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png?resize=1536,889 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/super-bowl-2022-install-growth.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1918px) 100vw, 1918px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274069\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sensor Tower<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/14\/super-bowl-2022-ads-for-tech-companies\/\">Super Bowl ad spots<\/a> paid off for a number of tech companies, not just in terms of exposure, but also app installs, a new report indicates.

App Annie and former CEO Bertrand Schmitt had to pay more than $10 million to settle the fraud charges related to its deceptive practices and making material misrepresentations about how its data was derived. The firm had used non-anonymized data to alter its estimates, and even directed engineers in China to manually update its estimates at times, before automating those adjustments to better match up with the actual &#8212; and confidential &#8212; revenue and download figures it had from clients. <em>Oops!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The new company name implies those days are behind it, as it references how it will fuel its digital insights using the power of artificial intelligence (AI).

The app also added support for alternative aspect ratios, more white balance controls, manual exposure controls and other features. <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/obscura-3-pro-camera\/id1579306989\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The new app<\/a> is double the price of the prior version at $9.99, but also ships with a Watch companion, support for connecting controllers and will soon offer Widgets and support for iPad.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/this-week-in-apps\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1952542\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"93\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png 2047w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=150,21 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=300,41 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=768,105 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=680,93 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=1536,210 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=50,7 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.

To get this in your inbox, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">subscribe here.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Since launching the venture firm Backstage Capital in 2015, Arlan Hamilton has invested millions in more than 195 companies led by underrepresented founders, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/loop-launches-out-of-stealth-to-make-auto-insurance-more-equitable\/\">from a duo taking on auto insurance <\/a>to a team <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/maven-series-a-a16z\/\">rethinking how we virtually learn<\/a>. Despite the breadth in the business, Hamilton says she is consistently asked two questions by her portfolio companies:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCan you help us raise money? And, \u201cCan you help us with hiring?\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274605\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>While Hamilton\u2019s fund is a response to the former, her latest bet &#8212; built by Hamilton herself &#8212; is a startup that explores the latter. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hirerunner.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Runner<\/a> is a labor marketplace that connects startups with operations people looking for part-time work. It seeks to combat some of the largest tensions in early-stage startup building, such as deciding when it\u2019s time to hire your first head of talent, or figuring out what to contract out, or what to build in-house when it comes to staffing. It\u2019s launching with an explicit focus on operations roles.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are so many places you can go if you want to learn how to code or if you want to get a job as in the more technical side of things,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cBut where do you go right now if you want to be someone\u2019s right hand, the COO, etc. \u2026 it\u2019s sort of an afterthought for most [companies].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, Runner isn\u2019t contrarian. Upwork and Fiverr have built solid businesses atop the freelancer economy. What\u2019s different about the startup, though, is in who it targets &#8212; operations folks in tech &#8212; and how it employs them. Every \u201crunner,\u201d or part-time professional who is looking to get a new gig, is employed by the company under a W-2 classification. Around 200 runners are on the platform today.<\/p>\n<p>And Hamilton tells TechCrunch the approach has attracted $1.5 million in pre-seed backing weeks before Runner is set to launch on the app store. For the entire story, including how one cohort of investors in the company is raising an interesting set of questions, read my story on TechCrunch: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/19\/arlan-hamilton-wants-to-reroute-how-startups-hire\/\">Arlan Hamilton wants to reroute how startups hire<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In the rest of this newsletter our heart will Flutter, and then it will ride the wild wave of crypto.

There\u2019s much to do, so let\u2019s dive into one startup\u2019s pivot from earlier in the week and, yes, talk a little about money.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274551\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<h2>Jukes, pivots<\/h2>\n<p>The esports world is a pretty fragmented place. Built atop different games, forums, tournament series, platforms, chat apps, and websites, it can be a legit effort to figure out what the hell is going on, even in your favorite game. So, <a href=\"https:\/\/juked.gg\/\">Juked.gg<\/a> set out to build a centralized news hub for all things esports back in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>The company saw some early success, raising a seven-figure round <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/23\/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently\/\">that we covered back in early 2021<\/a>. But according to co-founder <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fishstix?lang=en\">Ben Goldhaber<\/a>, the service had a period of rapid growth, what he described as \u201cup and to the right\u201d in graph form, before seeing its active user count plateau last year.<\/p>\n<p>What happened? According to Goldhaber, who also goes by the gamertag \u201cFishStix,\u201d Juked wound up serving the top 1% of esports fans, but wasn\u2019t reaching a larger audience. So, the nascent company did the smart thing of asking its users about its service and what they thought of it. From those conversations, Goldhaber said that users brought up issues endemic to esports like community toxicity, spam, and hot takes.<\/p>\n<p>So, Juked decided to pivot slightly and build the social network that its users were effectively asking for \u2013 a less toxic place to be an esports fan.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The product launched Thursday after a period in a closed alpha after having tested it with around 750 users before making it more generally available.<\/p>\n<p>According to information from AppAnnie (now Data.ai, apparently), the service did chart among iOS users in the United States this week, albeit only in the social networking category. We\u2019ll check back with the company in a few months to see how downloads shake out.<\/p>\n<p>Big questions remain, including how the service intends to combat toxicity at scale &#8212; I had to agree to a pretty strong set of terms to sign up. Juked intends to use human moderation with AI in the future, and requires users to sign up with a phone number. All good ideas, but untested for the company at mass scale.<\/p>\n<p>I dig what Juked has been working on because I am an esports fan. But I am also not precisely in the market for a new social network. Let\u2019s see how the startup\u2019s in-market juke can help it score more points. (And probably raise money, since it\u2019s been a year since its equity crowdfunding round, so we wouldn\u2019t fall over in shock if the company worked to pick up more cash in the coming quarters.)<\/p>\n<h2>A tale of two earnings calls<\/h2>\n<p>This week brought with it another sheaf of earnings calls from tech companies. And as always, we\u2019ve had our eyes tuned into the market for hints about what\u2019s ahead for startups.<\/p>\n<p>Most of our work <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/18\/for-startups-the-message-is-clear-grow-fast-or-die\/\">is here<\/a>, in our dive into just how important forward guidance is for tech companies today. Trailing results appear to be far less important to investors than what they see ahead. So when Amplitude got whacked by public-market investors, we took notes. There were other companies that took similar knocks, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/02\/facebook-meta-spotify-stocks\/\">including Meta<\/a>, so don\u2019t think that we\u2019re pointing a finger at the recently public Amplitude. (It <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/what-amplitudes-direct-listing-says-about-ipo-pops-and-how-startups-can-avoid-them\/\">direct-listed last year<\/a>, recall.)<\/p>\n<p>But there was another side to the coin, namely <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.appian.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/appian-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2021-financial\">Appian\u2019s earnings<\/a>. The low-code automation company has been a quieter public-market story than most tech debuts. That\u2019s not a diss, mind; its CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mattcalkins\/\">Matt Calkins<\/a> told me as much this week when discussing the company\u2019s results.<\/p>\n<p>How so? It boils down to Calkins\u2019 definition of what innovation is, and it\u2019s not just building something. Telling TechCrunch that his company has long been an engineering-led organization, he told us that it\u2019s not enough to make something cool. If the company doesn\u2019t <em>market<\/em> a new feature, sell it, and get it used, then it hasn\u2019t actually innovated. Innovation, he said, is an experience, not a product. The final result of innovation, he added, is a customer testimonial of a new feature \u2013 when someone will go on record and say that a new thing really is good. Which requires people to, well, know that something exists so that they can give it a whirl.<\/p>\n<p>I like his perspective. It helps explain why much of the so-called innovation in the blockchain world seems less like real innovation than the creation of a collection of <em>hypotheses<\/em>; yes, some of the more esoteric web3 products that are in the market today will have real impact, but most are more coding tricks than useful tools.<\/p>\n<p>A little more before I let you go. The staffing crunch that companies are feeling in the United States is not merely driving up the cost of hiring, it\u2019s helping companies like Appian. The company is seeing demand from customers to automate more of their work because employees don\u2019t want to do it. And unhappy employees bounce.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Appian\u2019s growth has been accelerating for a little while now. And it had an earnings report that led not to a share-price collapse, but a <em>gain<\/em>. Returning to our entry point for this conversation, that\u2019s the bar that companies have to clear today to grind out a few hundred basis points of market cap extension. It\u2019s a far harder market than a few quarters ago. Which is why, I think, the IPO window is kaput for some time yet.<\/p>\n<p>Hugs, and I hope your weekend is restful!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

Despite the breadth in the business, Hamilton says she is consistently asked two questions by her portfolio companies:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCan you help us raise money? And, \u201cCan you help us with hiring?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Hamilton\u2019s fund is a response to the former, her latest bet &#8212; built by Hamilton herself &#8212; is a startup that explores the latter. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hirerunner.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Runner<\/a> is a labor marketplace that connects startups with operations people looking for part-time work. It seeks to combat some of the largest tensions in early-stage startup building, such as deciding when it\u2019s time to hire your first head of talent, or figuring out what to contract out, or what to build in-house when it comes to staffing. It\u2019s launching with an explicit focus on operations roles.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274522\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThere are so many places you can go if you want to learn how to code or if you want to get a job as in the more technical side of things,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cBut where do you go right now if you want to be someone\u2019s right hand, the COO, etc. \u2026 it\u2019s sort of an afterthought for most [companies].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, Runner isn\u2019t contrarian. Upwork and Fiverr have built solid businesses atop the freelancer economy. What\u2019s different about the startup, though, is in who it targets &#8212; operations folks in tech &#8212; and how it employs them. Every \u201crunner\u201d or part-time professional who is looking to get a new gig is employed by the company under a W-2 classification. Around 200 runners are on the platform today, including those with experience in corporate roles or those who were previously entrepreneurs who want another stream of income.<\/p>\n<p>Many current executives at the company first joined as runners. For example, head of customer success Melanie Jones joined the platform after spending time as a product manager at a dental network. Within a month, she was hired as an executive, alongside a number of other runners-turned-decision-makers at the company. Separately, Boeing exec Dianna Moore joined as a COO just four months ago.<\/p>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">By classifying runners as employees instead of contractors, individuals are able to get basic protections and more job stability.

Before Backstage, Hamilton was a production coordinator and tour manager for musicians (she continues to pepper music references into her work as an investor). While in that role, she would often work with runners, or individuals with local expertise who could be a right-hand helper to make things happen while on the road. When she was building Backstage, she began using runners in her own life, hiring people for one-day help while meeting founders across the country.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After the investor saw synergies between this role within the production world and tech\u2019s love for flexibility, she brewed up Runner, with a logo and everything.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were building Backstage, we had no resources, because COVID hadn&#8217;t happened yet, people were really kind of confused by the idea of it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it was just one of those whiteboard ideas.\u201d Now, nearly two years into a still ongoing pandemic, the market is ready.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s business model is a 25% cut of a runner\u2019s hourly rate. Additionally, if a runner is recruited by a customer to join them full-time, the customer must pay a 10% recruitment fee of the runner\u2019s first year\u2019s salary.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Backstage, which wants to upend the way venture capital is distributed and to whom, Runner isn\u2019t building under the guise of helping companies recruit underrepresented talent &#8212; a choice Hamilton made, interestingly, because she didn\u2019t want to \u201cpigeonhole\u201d the company.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt would have been really easy for us to just categorize ourselves as a DEI recruitment company, but we didn\u2019t want to be responsible for that &#8212; it should be everyone\u2019s responsibility,\u201d she said. That said, today, all executives at Runner come from historically overlooked backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>Before it went to the waitlist model to better deal with demand, Runner secured around 120 pilot customers at a $500,000 run rate. Its app is set to launch on March 15, 2022.<\/p>\n<p>As for financing, Hamilton initially bootstrapped the company and, within the first 100 days, raised a $500,000 angel round. Most recently, Runner raised a $1.5 million pre-seed round on a SAFE note at an undisclosed valuation.<\/p>\n<p>Backers in that round include Precursor, Lunar Startups, Freada Klein of Kapor Capital, 360 Venture Collective and Gaingels. Backstage Capital\u2019s crowd syndicate, Backstage Flex Fund II and Backstage Opportunity Fund I, also invested in the startup.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s rare to see investors pour their own fund\u2019s money into a company they started, but, as Hamilton notes, it\u2019s not unheard of when you consider Guy Oseary\u2019s Sound Ventures investing in his company, Bright, or David Sacks&#8217; Craft Ventures investing in his audio company. Still, it can create a conflict of interest if decision-makers at the firm feel pressure to put money into a GP\u2019s company, because they are, well, the GP.<\/p>\n<p>Hamilton was part of the investment committee that decided to put money into Runner, but also gave each person authority to make autonomous decisions, she says. She also added that the eight-page deal memo &#8212; which gets into challenges, opportunity and gaps &#8212; was written by Backstage partner Brittany Davis, and associate Kelly Lei, without any alterations from her. The Runner team provided the pitch deck.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s my fiduciary duty at the firm to bring back returns, and it&#8217;s my duty as a CEO of Runner to bring in the best investment partners possible. I did both,\u201d Hamilton adds over Twitter DM. Another balance in the mix is that any Backstage portfolio company that uses Runner doesn\u2019t have to pay the 25% service fee, or the amount that goes to the company\u2019s revenue and operations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal is to have 1,000 or more [runners] by the end of the year making an average of $40,000,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201c[Then] we are a half a billion dollar company.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since launching the venture firm Backstage Capital in 2015, Arlan Hamilton has invested millions in more than 195 companies led by underrepresented founders, from a duo taking on auto insurance to a team rethinking how we virtually learn.

First, a note that much of TechCrunch is off Monday for a U.S. holiday, so some regular stuff might land a day later than usual. But we\u2019re a global team, so we will not be quiet to start next week. That\u2019s a promise. \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/18\/meta-axes-head-of-global-community-development-after-he-appears-on-video-in-underage-sex-sting\/\">Meta\u2019s fires community dev manager following sting<\/a><\/strong>: Meta, the parent company of Facebook and other social properties, has parted ways with a \u201cmanager of global community development,\u201d we report. The company tried to talk us out of the story, but the news matters in the context of other issues at the company that we outline in the post. That this news came amid a PR refresh for the company is also worth recalling.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/18\/for-startups-the-message-is-clear-grow-fast-or-die\/\">Grow quickly or die even faster<\/a><\/strong>: Tracking this particular earnings cycle has been watching a series of heads set rolling. Tech companies big and small have found themselves on the wrong end of investor discontent, thanks mostly to slower-than-anticipated growth projections. For startups, the lessons are pretty stark and clear: You have to grow like hell or watch your valuation implode.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/when-the-founder-becomes-the-story\/\">When the founder becomes the story<\/a><\/strong>: Ah, Bolt. We just can\u2019t stop talking about you, thanks to the fact that your former CEO keeps annoying the larger technology scene on the socials. This time Ryan Breslow, now merely the Bolt\u2019s executive chairman, went on a tirade about offering loans to help employees exercise their options. At issue are the facts that such action is not new and has led to some financial fiascos in the past.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Startups\/VC<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/18\/the-average-person-doesnt-have-a-chance-with-the-smart-home\/\">Smart homes aren\u2019t for normies<\/a><\/strong>: Have you wanted to change up your living situation so that it\u2019s more reactive, colorful and maybe even data-driven? Do you want, in other words, a <em>smarter<\/em> home? Well, maybe you really don\u2019t. TechCrunch columnist Owen Williams writes about his journey with the matter after buying a home. My takeaway is that if Owen is struggling, I\u2019d be flat doomed with trying to get the various tools to play nice with one another.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/18\/returnity-seed-round\/\">Soon your package may come in a reusable shipping wrapper<\/a><\/strong>: Like you, I buy too much stuff online, which means that I create more waste and recyclables than I really want to admit. Returnity is betting that a \u201csturdier packaging bag that can be used again and again\u201d will help ameliorate the situation and just raised capital for its efforts.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/18\/portuguese-vc-shilling-tops-up-its-founders-fund-hitting-59m-in-capital-to-deploy\/\">Portuguese VC fund boosts its capital pool<\/a><\/strong>: Venture capital firm Shilling has added $23 million to its \u201cFounders Fund\u201d after raising last year. This is good news for startups in the European country, and also good news for those of us who can come up with more than one joke about a venture capital fund named after what some participants in the asset class love to do on Twitter.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/18\/nous-seed\/\">Household-savings-as-a-service<\/a><\/strong>? That\u2019s what U.K.-based startup Nous wants to build. The gist is that the company will collect data from its customers and help them \u201cprogressively automate the management of essential service switching and\/or contact renegotiating.\u201d I never negotiate as I am a huge weenie. But if I had a service to help, well, I too would love to save more money.

And I certainly wasn\u2019t alone among the crowd at the Messe Berlin that IFA. The 5.3-inch display was unimaginably large in a year when the average screen measured a hair over 3.5 inches. The stylus graced the phone like a vestigial organ &#8212; some strange and unnecessary relic from the days of the Palm Pilot we\u2019d collectively (and happily) evolved away from.<\/p>\n<p>Samsung rightfully points out such skepticism in reference to more recent devices that received similar pushback, early on. It\u2019s something I think about a lot, faced with new innovations like foldable displays. You\u2019d have a pretty great track record if you spent your time betting on new innovation to fail. It\u2019s the nature of the beast &#8212; and this strange industry in which we find ourselves. The more radical the innovation, the more likely it is to faceplant.<\/p>\n<p>But the Note was a success by any reasonable metrics. Within nine months of launch, the company announced that it had sold 10 million units. It helped inject new ideas into a category that was already starting to feel stagnant 4.5 years after the arrival of the first iPhone. It saw Samsung working to find new ways to embrace the idea of a mobile-first virtual office in a post-Blackberry world and, perhaps most profoundly, it ushered in the era of the phablet. By 2014, even Apple had to admit that the age of celebrating 3.5\/4-inch as some kind of platonic screen size ideal was at an end with the introduction of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274470\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2266451\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2266451\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2266451\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0816.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2266451\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Not all of the Note\u2019s innovations were so transformational, of course. There was a period following the product\u2019s release when it felt like the stylus was having a moment. That perhaps the input device had been unfairly maligned on the mobile form factor. A number of manufacturers experimented with them, ultimately finding far more success with larger pencils designed specifically for tablets.<\/p>\n<p>Broader trends or no, the Note hung on to the S-Pen until the bitter end. It remained the one true differentiator as Samsung continually blurred the lines between it and the Galaxy S line, and in a bitter twist of irony, the smartphone S-Pen has now officially outlived the Galaxy Note as a brand. Ten years is a good run for a consumer electronics brand &#8212; particularly for a company like Samsung, which has a tendency toward the fickle, when it comes to brand names. Just look at the dance the company has done with its budget flagship brand.<\/p>\n<p>Toward the end, sales began to stagnate &#8212; and even drop &#8212; according to analytic firms. Though the Note certainly wasn\u2019t alone in that respect. The entire premium smartphone market suffered even prior to the pandemic. People simply weren\u2019t in the market to upgrade as quickly. Premium phones were getting more expensive and also good enough to keep around for an extra couple of years. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S line kept getting bigger and, last year, added S-Pen support.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2266447\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2266447\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2266447\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0827.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2266447\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Like many amid the Great Resignation, the Note took the year off to regroup. By the time 2022 rolled around, Samsung had declared its foldable line their own flagship, another piece of evidence that the Note wouldn\u2019t be returning. Once Samsung integrated the S-Pen slot into the Galaxy Ultra 22, the Note\u2019s spirit left its body and floated in the liminal region of brands that sometimes get mentioned in passing in marketing materials. Which is to say, in a conversation I had with a Samsung rep ahead of launch, they added that the company reserves the right to refer to a more abstract \u201cNote experience,\u201d with regards to features like S-Pen note taking. I said my piece around the announcement, but it bears repeating here: the Note brand is stronger &#8212; or at least more instantly recognizable &#8212; than Galaxy S. Samsung should keep it around, even if it\u2019s as the Galaxy S22 Note.<\/p>\n<p>We had a little time with the device ahead of launch a couple of weeks back. That\u2019s where a bunch of the photos in this story came from. Basically, it\u2019s a time to get shots of the product and play around with it a bit ahead of the official review. Naturally, I beelined directly toward the Galaxy S22 Ultra. The thing that occurred to me the moment I picked up the device is that it is, indeed, the Galaxy Note 22 in all but name. It looks like a Note, it acts like a Note, it notes like a Note.<\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019ve been wearing all black and lighting Galaxy Note-shaped candles, you can chill out now. Think of it as though the Note witnessed a terrible murder and had to go into government protection. Or it married a Galaxy S and took its last name. I dunno. Whichever makes you feel better.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2266431\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2266431\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2266431\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0904.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2266431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>What is interesting (and less discussed), however, is how the new device effectively disrupts the top of the S22 line. If you\u2019re a bell and whistle-type person when it comes to buying a new phone, the S-Pen is now among the bells and\/or whistles. It\u2019s the logical extension of Samsung\u2019s longstanding approach of going all in on the top end.<\/p>\n<p>Although $200 sepa11rates the S22 from the S22 Plus and the S22 Plus from the S22 Ultra, the former two share more common DNA than the latter two. In fact, display and battery size are the two meaningful distinctions. Those apply in the case of the S22 Plus versus the Ultra, as well, while the top-of-line device also gets a higher-res main camera and additional telephoto, more memory and storage options (though it starts at the samne 8GB, 128GB) 100x Space Zoom (versus 30x) and the aforementioned S-Pen and all that entails.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the basics of what you get for the $1,200 Galaxy S22 Ultra<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 6.8-inch display at 501 ppi<br \/>\n\u2022 Four rear-facing cameras: 108MP (wide), 12MP (ultrawide), 10MP (telephoto), 10MP (telephoto), 100x Space Zoom, 10x optical<br \/>\n\u2022 5,000mAh battery<br \/>\n\u2022 8GB-12GB RAM and 128GB-1TB storage<br \/>\n\u2022 4K video capture<br \/>\n\u2022 Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 (market dependent)<br \/>\n\u2022 In-display fingerprint reader<\/p>\n<p>The last three bullet points are the same across the board. But if, say, you want a 6.8-inch screen and 5,000mAh battery, instead of 6.6 inches and 4,500mAh, congratulations, you\u2019re getting an S-Pen, as well. The flip side of this is, of course, you won\u2019t get that Note functionality without spending at least $1,200. Samsung made it clear that it plans to maintain S-Pen functionality as a delineating factor between the ultra-premium and the rest of the Galaxy S line, moving forward.<\/p>\n<p>In the grand scheme of very expensive smartphones, I don\u2019t think any of this is end of the world type stuff, but there was bound to be at least a little friction when the company integrated one long-standing product line into the other. And listen, if I\u2019m being entirely honest with myself here, I think we\u2019d be critiquing the company for overly complicating things if suddenly there were like six S22 base models.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2266437\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2266437\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2266437\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0871.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2266437\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Samsung had to make some decisions here and it went toward making the S-Pen a super-duper premium feature. So suddenly some folks are going to have to ask themselves whether they like the S-Pen $200-400 worth.<\/p>\n<p>I certainly can\u2019t answer that question for anyone but myself. I\u2019ve long found the S-Pen to be an interesting and sometimes quite useful feature. Its evolution over the past decade has been a combination of software upgrades that have made it far more user friendly, with additions that felt like a company trying to figure out how to keep fresh the product\u2019s most interesting feature. Is using the stylus to advance PowerPoint slides wildly useful? Not really. Is it neat? Yeah, sure, kinda.<\/p>\n<p>On the truly useful side are improvements like Convert to Text. I\u2019m consistently impressed at how well it does with my wildly illegible chicken scratch. My writing is bad enough with a pen and paper, let alone stylus on a glossy screen, and yet the software nearly always figures out what I\u2019m attempting to communicate. Either my writing isn\u2019t as bad as I thought (it is, spoiler) or the software is very good (spoiler, it\u2019s this one).<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2266449\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2266449\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2266449\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/CMC_0823.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2266449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Samsung has done a fine job fulfilling the S-Pen\u2019s promise over the past decade. But even by the time first Note arrived, many users had already trained themselves to type proficiently on a touchscreen. For many, the Note was an entre into the world of large-screen phones that currently finds Samsung users choosing between 6.6 and 6.8 inches, on the high end. In its bid to improve the Galaxy S line, the company effectively cannibalized the Note.<\/p>\n<p>What we\u2019re left with, however, is a great (if, perhaps, overstuffed) fallout from more than a decade of smartphone wars. For all its heft, the S22 Ultra maintains a surprising sleek profile. The truth is that the original Galaxy Note was viewed as impossibly large, and in many ways, it fit the bill. In 2011, it took a lot more phone to support that much screen. But breakthroughs like edge-to-edge displays have managed to fit more screen into a smaller overall footprint.<\/p>\n<p>Make no mistake, the S22 Ultra is a tank at 6.43 x 3.07 x 0.35 inches. As an average size adult male with (anecdotally) average size hands, there were moments when the 8 ounce device felt unwieldy. It\u2019s the price you pay for going big. And, as Samsung would no doubt happily interject here, if it\u2019s too big a surface area for you, it\u2019s got a couple of foldables it\u2019ll happily sell you.<\/p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2269377,2269378,2269379,2269380,2269382,2269383,2269384,2269385,2269386,2269404,2269405,2269406,2269407,2269408,2269409,2269410,2269412,2269413\"]<\/p>\n<p>The cameras are top line here, too. I happily took it for a spin around my neighborhood on an unseasonably warm February morning. The S22 takes some of the best photos you can capture on a handset in 2022. Night shots have made impressive progress over the last few generations. Samsung\u2019s most meaningful competition on that front (and imaging, generally) is the latest Pixel, which finds Google giving in and finally admitting that hardware also matters.<\/p>\n<p>Night shots are one of the places you\u2019ll see the biggest difference between the Ultra and lower-speced S22 models &#8212; meaning that those improvements are likely to filter down in a generation or two. Space Zoom, too, offers a mind-boggling 100x, but that comes with a dramatic decrease in fidelity. I\u2019ve not seen a super compelling case that the feature has moved far beyond novelty. Features like nona-binning, which combines pixels shot with the 108MP sensor to allow more light in, are far more meaningful for everyday use.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274474\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274474\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2274474\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-5.38.45-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baby Brian, remastered<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Earlier additions like Photo Remaster and Object Eraser find the company continuing to improve on the software front.

We originally actually started out as a reusable shopping bag business that happened to have James Reinhardt (the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thredup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThredUp<\/a>) as a customer, buying reusable shopping bags. His challenge to us was if we can make a reasonable shipping bag. That&#8217;s where it all started,&#8221; recalls Mike Newman, CEO at Returnity. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been on this journey ever since. We had this reusable shopping bag we came up with, and we thought it was really cool, but it didn&#8217;t really go anywhere because we had to learn that packaging is really about systems &#8212; and not about product. If you don&#8217;t have a system to support reusable packaging, they just end up being press release programs. They don&#8217;t scale; they don&#8217;t sustain. A big part of our journey as a business &#8212; and I think for the reusable concept in general &#8212; has been that if we don&#8217;t build scalable, sustainable options for reuse, we&#8217;re never really going to make a dent in the packaging.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company is taking on an enormous challenge &#8212; more than 20 billion parcels are delivered every year in the U.S. (100 billionn worldwide, trending toward twice that over the next five years), resulting in an enormous amount of wasted materials. Reusable packaging makes sense, especially in industries where there&#8217;s a natural send-and-return model; the fashion rental industry, regular grocery deliveries and other businesses with regular delivery or pickup models, for example. Now, if you recall, there was a huge reduction in the amount of rental business that happened for a while &#8212; people weren&#8217;t renting high-end fashion clothing to sit in isolation in their living rooms, and Returnity had a brutal awakening in 2020.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274278\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We were poised for enormous growth in 2020. And then 80% of our revenue disappeared overnight, due to the pandemic shutdown. We really had to figure out how to be relevant beyond inherently circular businesses. If we hadn&#8217;t done that, we wouldn&#8217;t be where we are today,&#8221; says Newman. &#8220;That was a very painful part of our journey, but a necessary one because it forced us to confront some of these basic questions of how we work for brands.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company has a sizeable stack of pilot programs and case studies it is celebrating, too &#8212; including some with some seriously hard-hitting clients. For Walmart, the company supplies reusable bags optimized for home grocery delivery service and manages the cleaning and resupply of the packaging. For New Balance, it leads reusable shipping packaging deployment for the New Balance Team Sports initiative, creating an efficient and environmentally friendly system to ship samples to and from partners. This reusable packaging replaces 10,000 shipments of single-use cardboard boxes, and the company claims this reduces emissions up to 63%. It worked with Aveda to create its Returnable Shipper Program specifically for Aveda&#8217;s one-litre bottles. For Happy Returns, the company changes how goods are moved between stores and warehouses with <a href=\"https:\/\/locations.happyreturns.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its &#8220;Return Bar&#8221; network<\/a>. This means that shoppers can exchange and return e-commerce items without printing, packaging or person-to-person contact.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274428\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274428\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2274428\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg 4272w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Image-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274428\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Returnity is creating reusable packaging solutions that prevents huge amounts of cardboard and plastics going through the recycling loop. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Returnity<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The investment will help Returnity &#8220;double overnight,&#8221; adding account development bandwidth, improving the back-end and improving the product and marketing in ways the company hasn&#8217;t been able to date.

It also applied for a permit with the California Public Utilities Commission to charge for those rides, though the company has not yet received that permit.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Cruise opened up its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/01\/cruise-loaded-with-another-1-35b-from-softbank-opens-up-driverless-ride-hailing-to-the-public\/\">driverless robotaxi service<\/a> to the public in San Francisco. For now, these rides are free and a public waitlist has been set up via Cruise&#8217;s website. The company has previously said that members of the public who join the waitlist will not have to sign a non-disclosure agreement before using the service.<\/p>\n<p>Cruise&#8217;s initial driverless service is available from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Cruise tests its autonomous Chevy Bolt vehicles throughout San Francisco.

Over the last few months I\u2019ve spent hours researching things like smart light switches, sensors and blinds before spending any money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, even as someone who works in technology, it has amazed me just how <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">complicated <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the smart home still is: it\u2019s full of jargon and incompatible standards. Before buying anything, people who want to get into the &#8220;smart home&#8221; need to choose their ecosystems and technologies wisely from the outset or they\u2019ll be fidgeting with it for years &#8212; but no device maker is upfront with this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The basic goal of anyone building a smart home should be: which device do I want to primarily manage these things through? For most people, the best route is likely via a smart speaker like the Google Home, Amazon Alexa or Apple\u2019s HomePod, all of which will allow you to control those devices with your voice as well as a single app on your phone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem, however, is that the need for a single app or device to control all the smart things isn&#8217;t obvious until you end up with a few different devices that it\u2019s annoying to switch between via different apps to control each of your light bulbs.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means the average smart home dabbler needs to somehow understand whether the thing they\u2019re buying will work with Google Home and Amazon Alexa, if they have any smart speakers. Then, if they own an iPhone, they need to understand what Apple\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ca\/ios\/home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HomeKit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> standard is, which allows them to use Siri and the Home app on iOS as well (and is well worth the effort, providing a single app that controls your entire home).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2273571\" style=\"width: 2350px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2273571\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2273571 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png\" alt=\"Owen's HomeKit setup \" width=\"2340\" height=\"2532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png 2340w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png?resize=139,150 139w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png?resize=277,300 277w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png?resize=768,831 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png?resize=628,680 628w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png?resize=1420,1536 1420w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png?resize=1893,2048 1893w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Frame-1.png?resize=46,50 46w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2340px) 100vw, 2340px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2273571\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Owen&#8217;s HomeKit setup.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, perhaps they realize they want to get sensors to automate those devices to do things like having the lights turning on when they enter a room, they\u2019ll likely need to consider the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.z-wave.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Z-Wave<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/csa-iot.org\/all-solutions\/zigbee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zigbee <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">standards, which unlock automation for any device regardless of manufacturer, but often requires an additional hub to function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also important but not immediately obvious is whether or not a device connects directly to your Wi-Fi or via a hub of some kind, which needs to be plugged into your router. I\u2019ve found over the years that the latter is better, even though it might be counterintuitive, because it means you aren\u2019t dealing with Wi-Fi dead zones, devices vanishing from your network without explanation or needing to reconnect every single light switch if you change the network name down the road. But, having six different hubs for each manufacturer\u2019s devices is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a little ridiculous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2273576\" style=\"width: 4042px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2273576\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2273576 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"Owen's smart hubs in a closet\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_1355-Copy.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2273576\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The author&#8217;s messy smart hubs piled up in a closet.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart home geeks will be quick to point you in the direction of open source projects like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/homebridge.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homebridge<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.home-assistant.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home Assistant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which run on a Raspberry Pi, to bridge these ecosystems for many devices regardless of whether their creators actually support it. These projects are impressive and enable a lot of incredible smart home setups, but the mere suggestion of this is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">absurd <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for the average person, given the difficulty involved, and should be a demonstration of why the smart home has failed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I researched devices for weeks to avoid as much pain as possible when setting up our new home, ultimately settling on a set of brands that I\u2019d stick to throughout the home because I knew they worked with Google Home, Amazon Alexa <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple\u2019s HomeKit platform. For smart lights, I replaced all of my light switches with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.casetawireless.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lutron Caseta<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are widely regarded as &#8220;rock solid,&#8221; and I refused to introduce any other brand of smart switch. Since we were moving into a new home with no blinds, we also invested in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.serenashades.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lutron\u2019s Serena Shades<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> smart blinds, which allow automation of your blinds and connect to the same system. In any lamps or for accent lighting, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.philips-hue.com\/en-ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Philips Hue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is my go-to, and so on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m not immune to the pitfalls I described, ironically: I already owned a few Kasa smart plugs before moving into our new home, which aren\u2019t compatible with HomeKit, and would have meant I would be unable to automate them in the Apple Home app to work with my other devices, and our house came with a Samsung smart fridge and oven that also aren\u2019t compatible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, despite my planning I still wound up setting up Homebridge to make them work in harmony anyway, which worked great after I fiddled for a while, eventually tricking everything into working as if it were officially supported. But, I\u2019d hazard a guess the mere mention of running a terminal command on a Raspberry Pi is a non-starter for most casual smart home shoppers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hope on the horizon, with large smart home companies jumping onboard a new standard called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/csa-iot.org\/all-solutions\/matter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matter<\/span><\/a>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which promises to provide a \u201cfoundation for connected things\u201d by ensuring they can all talk to one another, regardless of which ecosystem you\u2019re in.

That may all be true, but it isn&#8217;t enough. The world is full of examples where the second-best product wins. HD-DVD was objectively better than Blu-ray, but the former was brutally ground to dust by Sony. There are a thousand solutions that are better than Jira, but hordes of product managers are using it through gritted teeth. And the annals of startup history are litered with companies that built supremely efficient machines that were ready for incredible scale, only for the demand to never materialize. One great example of that is WebVan, which built millions of dollars&#8217; worth of logistics and operations, only to never quite get the customers it needed &#8212; for a great analysis of that particular disaster, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/eBoys-Inside-Account-Venture-Capitalists\/dp\/0812930959\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read &#8220;eBoys&#8221;, the story of Benchmark capital<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As a startup CEO, you have three jobs: Don&#8217;t run out of money, set the direction and culture of the company and &#8212; most importantly &#8212; hire the right team. The latter is the crux of everything you do, because it is what enables you to pivot.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273948\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Stewart Butterfield is a good example of a founder who does this particularly well. He has attempted to start a games company several times, and &#8220;failed&#8221; every time. The first time he built a game, his company wanted a mechanism for sharing pictures and screenshots. The second time he built a game, he discovered that it was hard to communicate with his teammates and keep everyone in the loop on what they needed to know. They built tools to solve both of these problems and spun those tools out as separate businesses. You may have heard of them &#8212; Flickr for photo sharing, and Slack for internal communication. Both turned out to be supremely successful companies. And both were possible because the founding team didn&#8217;t hold on too tightly to their original idea; they spotted an idea, validated that it might be a good idea and then pivoted the company.<\/p>\n<p>The important thing about hiring is to hire folks who are inspired, inspiring and curious. You need team members who are willing to develop deep domain expertise. If you are building a HIPAA-compliant SaaS solution for electronic patient records, you&#8217;re not just hiring a team that can solve those specific problems. Yes, that is what you need in the <em>now<\/em>, but the magic of startups is that you don&#8217;t quite know what comes next. You&#8217;re not building a specialist team at first &#8212; that can wait until you hit a growth stage in earnest, when you need true, deep specialists who can solve these problems in a best-in-class way.<\/p>\n<p>At the earliest stages of founding a company, you are collecting a gang of humans who care about patient confidentiality, data safety, compliance and user experience, and who can apply those skills to different problems. Startups need to be nimble; if an unbeatable competitor shows up out of the blue, side-step the challenge by redefining what you are doing. Don&#8217;t fight in the red, blood-soaked ocean against behemoth competitors that can out-spend you at every turn; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition\/dp\/1591396190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">find that blue-ocean strategy<\/a> where you are choosing a slice of the market that nobody is interested in just now.<\/p>\n<p>With one of my recent companies, we were building a virtual events platform. That was exciting because we launched within weeks of a certain pandemic that caused a bunch of lockdowns &#8212; and we saw incredible growth as a result. It was also exciting because out of the blue, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era\/\">our biggest competitor was the fastest-growing startup of all time<\/a>. We had an amazing team, and were able to pivot into a niche that nobody else was serving at scale: white-label events for companies that deeply care about the branded experience of their events. Sure, it was a very small slice of the market, but it was a blue-ocean strategy with extremely high-value customers who paid orders of magnitude more for highly customized events.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve worked as an advisor to a few hundred startups, both in my role as director of Portfolio at a venture firm, and as an independent advisor. Without fail, the strongest startup teams are the ones that are versatile, hungry and knowledgeable. The startups launch minimum viable products (a misnomer, because they aren&#8217;t minimal, they aren&#8217;t viable and they aren&#8217;t products) &#8212; often defined as &#8220;the smallest amount of work you can do to validate a hypothesis&#8221;. In the process of running these experiments, the companies learn a tremendous amount about what the customers want. They learn about pricing, about the problems they are solving, about the buying dynamics of the customers, about the competitive landscape and the different business models that are available to them.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of the time, a company gets six-nine months down a path and realizes that their original assumptions weren&#8217;t completely accurate. At that point, they have a choice: double down and pig-headedly continue down the path &#8212; and some startup founders are able to will their companies into being and find tremendous success that way. The other option is to pivot; take the hard-earned knowledge you picked up along the way, and leverage the flexible team you&#8217;ve built to pick a different direction. Abandon that game you were building in favor of building a communications tool. Give up on the generalist virtual events platform and build a specialist, niche product that can give you a foothold in the market. Or turn to your team and say &#8220;hey; this isn&#8217;t going to work, but we learned a lot about this industry over the past year. What other problems have you guys spotted, that we can start looking at?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Over-specialization too early means you build a sniper rifle of a company, perfectly designed to solve a very specific problem in a tightly defined way. If you&#8217;re lucky, that may work &#8212; but what you really need to maximize your chances of success is a shotgun and as many shells as you can carry. Hire accordingly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Blank&#8217;s definition of a startup is &#8220;a temporary organization in the search of a repeatable business model&#8221;.

All those aforementioned \u201clayers\u201d aren\u2019t designed to work together.<\/p>\n<p>Even before you add on clinical support algorithms, radiologists are already working with three or four different pieces of software, said Andrews. Then, if you want to add on a new software program that employs AI capabilities, you have to add yet another to that bundle. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8082344\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As one review paper<\/a> in Radiology Artificial Intelligence notes, robust AI software requires the installation of vendor-specific software on individual workstations. This process, the paper notes, can add complexity when it comes to adopting new technology.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe recognized that the underlying radiology IT stack itself, and the underlying imaging IT stack more broadly, is fundamentally unable to handle both the tasks that radiologists have, and the tasks that third-party AI and software vendors are going to be demanding of it in the next decade,\u201d said Andrews.<\/p>\n<p>In that light, Sirona\u2019s acquisition of Nines will unite those top-layer algorithms into RadOS. What does that actually mean for doctors? It means they\u2019ll be able to move seamlessly from an annotated image, to report. A doctor could now click on a lung nodule, have it measured using Nines algorithm, and then with another click, insert that measurement into a report.<\/p>\n<p>This seems almost mind-numbingly simple. And yet despite that, it was \u201cimpossible to achieve,\u201d Andrews said.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274202\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274202\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2274202\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Product-Screenshot-Reporter-With-Template.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Product-Screenshot-Reporter-With-Template.png 1348w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Product-Screenshot-Reporter-With-Template.png?resize=150,76 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Product-Screenshot-Reporter-With-Template.png?resize=300,152 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Product-Screenshot-Reporter-With-Template.png?resize=768,390 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Product-Screenshot-Reporter-With-Template.png?resize=680,346 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Product-Screenshot-Reporter-With-Template.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274202\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The note-taking application fueled by the RadOs platform. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sirona Medical<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAI and computer vision represents the ability to correlate pixels with words, [and] natural language processing represents the ability to correlate words back to the pixels themselves,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat bi-directional connectivity cannot be achieved today because software used to create the report and the software used to look at images are functionally separate.

developers<\/a> using the cloud-native tools \u2014 an increase of 67% from the year prior.<\/p>\n<p>For those who need a refresher on Kubernetes, it is an open source container project created by Google in 2014 to automate, monitor and run applications.<\/p>\n<p>Kubernetes is one of the most-used tools by cloud-native developers and can be challenging as a company grows, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kubecost.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kubecost<\/a> aims to alleviate some of those growing pains through its open source tools for monitoring, managing and optimizing Kubernetes spend at scale.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274179\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The company was founded in 2019 by two former Google employees, Webb Brown and Ajay Tripathy, who previously worked on infrastructure monitoring solutions for Google infrastructure and Google Cloud.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere has been a problem in the space around cost, performance and reliability, by far, with this major transition to containers,\u201d Brown told TechCrunch. \u201cTeams were getting benefits, but totally sacrificing visibility in spending, kind of like having a payroll of millions of dollars, but not knowing what department, team or individuals are getting paid what.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Without that visibility, Brown explained that the downstream effects could be seen in additional waste \u2014 he has seen teams overspend, in some cases, by 80% when they don\u2019t know the cost of a product.<\/p>\n<p>Recognizing the need for teams to have spending safety nets to cushion for future shocks, Kubecost set out to provide the real-time cost visibility and insights required to continuously monitor and reduce millions of dollars in Kubernetes-related cloud costs.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s core product is open source and freely available for teams, something Brown said will always be true. It also has a commercial product for enterprises that can be functionally installed in minutes and tried or used without having to talk to sales.<\/p>\n<p>Customers don\u2019t have to share information with Kubecost, but instead the technology takes the open source information and brings it into the customer\u2019s environment and integrates with its cloud or on-premise data center.<\/p>\n<p>From there, information is collected in real time and insights provided that show all the areas where a company is spending resources, driving up costs and why costs are going up. Kubecost then provides insights on how to reduce costs and sends alerts or can help set policies so that it can be managed over time.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274182\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274182\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2274182\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png\" alt=\"Kubecost\" width=\"1024\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png 1857w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png?resize=150,62 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png?resize=300,123 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png?resize=768,316 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png?resize=680,279 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png?resize=1536,631 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Kubecost.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274182\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Kubecost<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7tKGHBWGUU\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/04\/how-kubernetes-came-to-rule-the-world\/\">How Kubernetes came to rule the world<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Kubernetes came to rule the world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/04\/how-kubernetes-came-to-rule-the-world\/embed\/#?secret=YdOzhrDYTS#?secret=7tKGHBWGUU\" data-secret=\"7tKGHBWGUU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Kubecost is already working with more than 2,000 companies, including over 100 enterprise customers \u2014 a number that went up three times over last year with five times the engagement metrics \u2014 and manages over $2 billion in Kubernetes spend. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenue is growing three times year over year. Brown did not share a specific company valuation, but did say it went up five times from last year.<\/p>\n<p>With adoption expected to continue on its trajectory, the company secured $25 million in Series A funding in a round, led by Coatue Management, with participation from seed investors First Round Capital and Afore Capital. As part of the investment, Coatue partner David Cahn will join Kubecost\u2019s board of directors.<\/p>\n<p>The new capital will be investing in hiring across the board. Kubecost\u2019s origins started with open source, and Brown plans to make some major investments in that community and on more features. It is also preparing to implement tons of new features, integrations with other products in the ecosystem and more development on insights and optimizations.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the company is also starting its journey with \u201cHosted Kubecost,\u201d a value-add for teams that, after trying the product, want to let the company manage the functionalities on their behalf.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOverall, there has been an amazing wave of fundamental transformation from cloud to containers, which when you look at it is as big as the transition from data centers to the cloud, so we expect that to continue,\u201d Brown said. \u201cKubernetes is at the heart of the modern enterprise tech stack. We plan to go deeper there to make transitions and get to a high-scale product that can run all applications through it.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Z08f9SrpmZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/10\/vcs-are-betting-big-on-kubernetes-here-are-5-reasons-why\/\">VCs are betting big on Kubernetes: Here are 5 reasons why<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

Worse is yet to come as an energy price cap will end in April, when bills are projected to rise by more than 50%. The poorest households describe a stark choice &#8212; between &#8216;heating or eating&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Into this grim maelstrom a new London-based startup, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nous.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nous<\/a>, is hoping to throw households a life-raft by offering a free personalized report that explains how price rises will affect their costs and gives advice on how to adapt to inflation.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273030\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>That&#8217;s just step one, though. The startup&#8217;s wider pitch and &#8220;social mission&#8221; is to use (first party) household finance data and (third party) vendor data to build models that can progressively automate the management of essential service switching and\/or contact renegotiating to offer a sort of household savings-as-a-(subscription)-service.<\/p>\n<p>Nous, which is pronounced to rhyme with &#8216;house&#8217;, talks in terms of building an &#8220;autopilot&#8221; for routine household decisions &#8212; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which spans and scans energy, insurance, mortgages, broadband and other subscription services to monitor activity and steer households onto better deals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The startup projects that its future subscription service will be able to save a &#8220;typical&#8221; household more than \u00a31,000 a year. (Its own service pricing would of course need to be set well below that to convince hard hit consumers to buy in.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Nous tells us it even envisages being able to take on a public &#8216;punching-up&#8217; role &#8212; once\/if it&#8217;s operating at scale, with high level visibility into the consumer experience &#8212; saying it could call out vendors it sees trying to pull a swift one, such as sneaking in an extra price hike under the guise of a standard inflation rate rise, to use transparency and shame to force-correct bad behavior. (The success that food poverty campaigner, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BootstrapCook\/status\/1492539062103814144\">Jack Monroe<\/a>, has had using social media to publicly call out massively over-inflationary price rises in supermarket &#8216;basics&#8217; food lines &#8212; or footballer, Marcus Rashford using his social platform to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-55628428\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drive change to free school meal contracts<\/a> by showcasing horribly inadequate provision &#8212; may provide some inspiration on that front.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But first the fledgling startup has to do the hard work of nailing down data access, pulling off bespoke modelling and executing on automation technologies to deliver on its consumer-friendly promise of savvy and seamless service switching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For now, the 2021-founded startup is busy with product development. Currently it&#8217;s running a closed beta as it works<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> to develop models and hone decision-making heuristics with the goal of building tech that can proactively protect consumers from opportunistic vendor price hikes and loyalty taxes. Or, well, that&#8217;s the dream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">As well as a dream, Nous has substantial money behind it &#8212; i<\/span>t&#8217;s just closed a $9 million seed round &#8212; so clearly isn&#8217;t in danger of a cash crisis itself.<\/p>\n<p>It can tout a long list of early investors who have bought into a vision that co-founder and CEO, Greg Marsh, says aims to leverage the power of data to work <em>for<\/em> not against the consumer for once.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always felt to me to be something very problematic about the way that just as direct debit and other fintech innovations have created a lot of convenience for householders they&#8217;ve also made us susceptible &#8212; precisely because I can pay for my energy, I can pay for my mobile phone, I can pay for my car insurance on this sort of automatic mechanism&#8230; but that convenience creates this power imbalance because it puts the onus on individual householders to pay an enormous amount of attention exactly to where their money is going,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, explaining the problem Nous is being built to tackle.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In theory you can do that&#8230; but in practice, unless you are very, very self-disciplined, people don&#8217;t do that. And instead what [happens] &#8212; and it&#8217;s particularly households at the lower end of the income distribution, who are less financially sophisticated or who are just really, really busy&#8230; those householders get completely screwed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Marsh argues that this situation &#8212; where consumers who aren&#8217;t hyper vigilant will end up overpaying for core services &#8212; is not the result of a few &#8216;bad apple&#8217; suppliers. It&#8217;s &#8220;systemic dysfunction&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically everyone plays this game in the industry and all the pricing analysts and all the revenue management departments in all of these providers are playing the same very cynical game &#8212; which is how can I get someone in at a low price, how can I sell them a few things they don&#8217;t quite need&#8230; so people just end up massively overpaying,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;So it&#8217;s that sense that unless you are really on it you will get taken advantage of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nous&#8217; contention is that a for-profit company can help fix systemic abuse by offering a subscription service &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s clearly batting for the consumer. Albeit also as a for-profit company with a clear &#8220;social mission&#8221;. (And on that front Marsh notes that Nous intends to apply for &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/B_Corporation_(certification)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B Corp&#8217; status<\/a> to back up its &#8220;strict&#8221; pledge of neutrality vis-a-vis service vendors.)<\/p>\n<p>He argues this model is in marked contrast to the crop of (free-to-access) &#8220;web 1.0&#8221; price comparison\/service switching websites which monetize consumer advice in other, less up-front ways &#8212; such as ads, affiliate links and\/or taking a commission direct from vendors &#8212; asserting they can&#8217;t therefore claim to be entirely impartial or always working solely in the consumer&#8217;s interest. (Aka &#8220;he who pays the piper calls the tune&#8221;, as Marsh puts it.)<\/p>\n<p>Whereas Nous&#8217; business model will be pure &#8220;boring&#8221; subscription; no ads, no service provider commissions. And that means it <em>has<\/em> to be pro-consumer since the consumer will be the one actually paying for the service.<\/p>\n<p>Literally Nous&#8217; customers will be paying it to save them money. So the relationship is clear.<\/p>\n<p>Talking of money, Nous&#8217; substantial seed raise was led by early stage London-based Mosaic Ventures (an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/08\/mosaic-ventures\/\">erstwhile Series A investor<\/a>), with participation from more than 65 angel investors &#8212; including the likes of Tom Blomfield (co-founder of GoCardless &amp; Monzo); Marc Warner (co-founder &amp; CEO of Faculty.ai); Dan Hegarty (founder &amp; CEO of digital mortgage broker Habito); Eamon Jubbawy (co-founder of fintech unicorn Onfido); serial entrepreneur Brent Hoberman; ActiveHotels (Booking.com) co-founder Andy Phillipps; ex-number-10 strategist John Gibson (aka, one of the original architects of OpenBanking); plus the former head of Amazon UK; and John Fingleton, the former head of the OFT (now CMA), among others &#8212; so its pitch has evidently turned a lot of wealthy heads.<\/p>\n<p>The founding team looks similarly seasoned.<\/p>\n<p>Marsh himself is no startup debutant; previously he&#8217;s worked for Index Ventures. He also exited his prior startup, an upscale &#8216;Airbnb&#8217; called Onefinestay, to AccorHotels <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/04\/accorhotels-acquires-onefinestay-for-170-million\/\">back in 2016<\/a> for $170M &#8212; before moving to the US to do a stint lecturing at Harvard Business School. Family commitments brought him back to London and back to scratching his entrepreneurial itch as one of four co-founders at Nous.<\/p>\n<p>The other three co-founders are: Christian H\u00f8lmer, CTO<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">;<\/span> Jon Rudoe, chief commercial officer; and Glen Walker, COO, who was a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/27\/trouva-an-online-marketplace-for-independent-boutiques-raises-22m\/\">Trouva<\/a> co-founder. The current leadership team also includes a woman: Lydia Howland, who is head of service development. And, as a whole, the team packs in a lot of cross-industry and tech expertise &#8212; spanning stints at Facebook, Deliveroo, Ocado, Sainsbury&#8217;s and McKinsey, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The large size of Nous seed round is a measure of the calibre of the team, per Marsh. Or, put another way, experienced talent does not come cheap.<\/p>\n<p>As well as shelling out for talent, Nous&#8217; seed will be used to get the first products to market &#8212; and for early scaling within the UK where it remains focused for now.<\/p>\n<p>Its first product &#8212; due for launch within &#8220;a few weeks&#8221;, per Marsh (&#8220;hopefully early Q2&#8221;) &#8212; will be a free cost of living dashboard offering insights that it says will arm consumers by providing &#8220;clarity&#8221; on price rises; projecting how inflation will affect their finances, and offering support via suggestions of how they may be able to reduce the impact of rising costs on their household.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It will show you on a personalized basis how upcoming price rises are going to affect you and your specific household situation,&#8221; explains Marsh. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to do that analysis on a personalized basis to be useful. That&#8217;s not only useful because it provides insight &#8212; it&#8217;s also quite actionable insight. So it immediately alerts people to situations where they could jump on it if they have time and energy. But it also, we hope, will help inform people &#8212; as they have conversations with their employee rep or even directly with their employer about pay rises and things like that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As noted above, Nous&#8217; grand vision is a big data automation play that will (at least to a degree) take over the management of household finances &#8212; absorbing the administrative tedium associated with spotting predatory price rises and switching onto better deals by, for example, simplifying the process of getting quotes to move to a new supplier.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We already know, in our alpha testing, we can already see when switches should take place,&#8221; says Marsh. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not always switching, sometimes it&#8217;s also managing an existing vendor relationship. Sometimes it&#8217;s nudging someone to act where it&#8217;s actually relatively easy for them to act but making the action easier to accomplish. So the archetype of this is if you got to the comparison websites and you have to full in a 44-item questionnaire in order to get a quote for a new insurance product. Actually 39 of those items are information that we already know or can accurately infer. So all we really need to ask is one or two questions &#8212; clarifying questions or confirmatory questions &#8212; and those one or two questions then allow us, with you authority, to go and sample the market and figure out if there is a better opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So you turn something that was previously a chore, and involved the big screen, into a quick thing you can do at the bus stop on your device and problem solved. So it&#8217;s partly about surfacing the action in a way that it&#8217;s easy for someone to grab and deal with and it&#8217;s partly around just deploying deploying better, smarter, existing technology solutions to make those processes more ergonomic, more convenient and easier. It also goes back to having an ongoing relationship with a household, rather than a transactional relationship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to make it really easy for households so that on the margin this is something they do, rather than something they leave until tomorrow,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;This stuff is boring, it&#8217;s stressful, it&#8217;s inconvenient, it creates anxiety &#8212; all the reasons why humans leave til tomorrow the thing they should do today. Which is precisely why direct debit creates convenience but it also creates the opportunity for people to be abused.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very, very conscious &#8212; firstly of how important this is &#8212; but also how hard it&#8217;s going to be to get that level of trust and confidence with people that they are willing to share the information with us and that we can actually help them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This premium product will be the subscription service and that clear billing will, it hopes, provide customers with reassurance that it is working to look after their interests &#8212; and not doing anything nefarious with their data. (Its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nous.co\/privacy-statement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy statement<\/a> also states upfront: &#8220;We don\u2019t make our money through advertising or selling data.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to be a business that&#8217;s fundamentally sitting with consumers, fighting for them,&#8221; adds Marsh. &#8220;Which is one of the reasons why we&#8217;ve ended up thinking so specifically about a subscription model &#8212; in a sense it&#8217;s the hardest thing for us to do because to justify a subscription model we&#8217;re going to have to delivery an enormous amount of real value.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But if we can get there &#8212; we think we can &#8212; and when we get there the place it allows us to occupy is a place that&#8217;s genuinely on the households side, not secretly selling thing because there&#8217;s commission revenue there or secretly advertising through the backdoor and actually being in the pocket of providers of mortgage services or providers of insurance services or providers of energy services.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The goal is to launch the subscription product this year too, although Marsh won&#8217;t be tied to a more specific timeframe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Open data and service access<\/h2>\n<p>For Nous&#8217; business to function as intended, it&#8217;s clear that access to data &#8212; both on the consumer spending side and on the vendor pricing\/tariff side &#8212; will be paramount.<\/p>\n<p>That means this startup is a clear beneficiary of UK regulations that open up access to market and\/or customer data, via initiatives such as OpenBanking that are designed to unlock innovation by fostering consumer trust.<\/p>\n<p>OpenBanking is obviously one critical piece for Nous, as the visibility it will get into household finances and spending will flow, in large part, from consumers who agree to connect their bank accounts, via this standard, providing it with a core feed of data on household incomings and outgoings.<\/p>\n<p>The full detail of services contracts won&#8217;t be found in bank accounts, though. But here Nous also hopes to convince consumers to provide it with access to parse their email accounts &#8212; where it can apply automation technologies to extract and distil relevant intel from vendor comms to better understand service provision (and consumer demands).<\/p>\n<p>It undoubtedly faces a bit of a chicken and egg challenge of needing enough consumer trust to gain enough account access to build enough utility which &#8212; Nous and its investors&#8217; are convinced &#8212; will ultimately win it a steady revenue stream of subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also clear that the free product has a very critical role of onboarding accounts (and data) to support Nous&#8217; product development and overall mission, as well as acting as a customer acquisition funnel where it can upsell its premium product.<\/p>\n<p>Marsh is candid that getting all the necessary information for Nous to effectively manage household services with only minimal &#8216;steerage&#8217; needed from the household is a core challenge.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no silver bullet. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s one data feed which just solves this problem,&#8221; he admits. &#8220;You get broad and shallow information from an OpenBanking data feed across multiple household accounts, you a searchlight data from connecting email accounts over time. You get information by connecting into walled garden services here and there &#8212; but not every provider will let you into those walled gardens, some are very defensive about their data because, let&#8217;s be honest, they have a lot to lose.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The last thing that mobile phone providers really want is for people to really understand that they could probably save \u00a3150 a year if they moved onto a better tariff&#8230; that&#8217;s straight out of the profit line of the mobile phone companies. So we&#8217;re not complacent about this being an easy journey and we think there will be tension and friction over time. But we also think we&#8217;re doing the right thing by trying to be on the customer&#8217;s side and trying to make their lives simpler and fairer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Nous&#8217; automated advice will only be as good as the data it&#8217;s able to access &#8212; so the more users it can attract, and the greater demographic variety across its user-base, the richer its market intelligence, and the broader utility its service may provide.<\/p>\n<p>On the latter point there is a clear risk that a subscription service won&#8217;t be able to help those most in need in a cost of living crisis (since it is another upfront cost) &#8212; and low uptake at the low income end could mean Nous&#8217; visibility into (and support for) household finances gets skew toward the &#8216;squeezed middle&#8217;, rather than the most vulnerable.<\/p>\n<p>If so, a marketing strategy that foregrounds talk of &#8216;getting wise to the cost of living crisis&#8217; could risk looking cynical and opportunistic &#8212; because the service may not actually be reaching those households in the direst need.<\/p>\n<p>Those on the lowest incomes will certainly be the hardest to help as a subscription business since there&#8217;s no escaping that it is yet another outlay for people who are already struggling and may not be able to access credit (let alone take a punt on paying more now in the hopes of saving later).<\/p>\n<p>But when asked about this Marsh says the team is looking at potentially offering the subscription product free to households that qualify for the government&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/the-warm-home-discount-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warm Homes Discount scheme<\/a> &#8212; as one way to expand its socioeconomic coverage.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Elderly people, too, are often on very low incomes and can be among the most vulnerable to predatory price hikes that rely on consumers closely tracking tariff changes. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">And this cohort of households may also be disproportionately likely to receive paper-based bills from service providers &#8212; and may not even be signed up for online banking, let alone tech savvy enough to know how to connect their account to OpenBanking. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">So, again, helping that very-vulnerable-to-the-cost-of-living-crisis demographic via a data-fuelled subscription platform play may be difficult &#8212; without ploughing major effort into targeted outreach and support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Responding on the general point, Marsh essentially argues that Nous has to start somewhere. Albeit that somewhere is &#8220;an intersection between where we can quickly and conveniently get data&#8221; &#8212; underlining what the &#8216;digital divide&#8217; means in practice: The tech savvy and digitally armed stand to benefit first and (likely) most.<\/p>\n<p>If Nous can successfully scale a service he does also suggests there would be scope to focus more on addressing harder to reach households, such as by bolting on document scanning tools (i.e. so people could snap a photo of a paper bill to upload the data).<\/p>\n<p>He also notes that Nous is doing outreach to financial literacy charities &#8212; and says it&#8217;s keen to work with relevant support services to serve its wider social mission.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">But it will undoubtedly have its work cut out to ensure that data-driven and automation-enabled cost savings don&#8217;t further entrench what are already massively unfair socioeconomic divides.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the question of why others haven&#8217;t tried a subscription model to tackle the problem of predatory services, Marsh suggests this is &#8212; at least in part &#8212; linked to the maturing regulatory environment &#8212; which has been getting more conducive to intermediaries.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have been able to build this business ten years ago. It would have been almost impossible. Until things like OpenBanking became properly implemented,&#8221; he says, noting that one of Nous&#8217; investors was a key government sponsor of that initiative and adding: &#8220;It&#8217;s great to see the UK actually having taken the lead on some of this stuff.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The UK&#8217;s approach of targeted, sector specific regulation provides an operational framework for third parties like Nous to access data and perhaps act as an agent on consumers&#8217; behalf. So it&#8217;s a case of regulation enabling consumer-focused innovation in these particular services markets.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t understate the important of this &#8212; the UK has a surprisingly sophisticated environment or ecosystem of sectoral regulation,&#8221; says Marsh. &#8220;So actually, although they are far from perfect, what the Ofcoms or Ofgems and the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] and so on have done, sector by sector, is they have increasingly created an environment where vendors have to support data sharing and they have to allow agent-led switching.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the most extreme expression of that so far in the energy sector. Where energy companies are obliged to allow third parties authorized by households to manage the switch for them,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;The same sort of stuff is now increasingly mandated in other verticals. So [while] there will be some sectors which are more resistant to this but increasingly it&#8217;s very, very hard for vendors to stand against that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He does not rule out future international expansion into other markets where the team believes the model could also work &#8212; assuming, of course, the right regulatory framework is in place. But it&#8217;s fully focused on helping UK homes for now.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the last 12 months we&#8217;ve been watching with increasing concern just how serious the cost of living increases are actually going to be for UK households. And I know it&#8217;s making headlines now &#8212; it is going to hit really hard. And it&#8217;s going to keep hitting; it&#8217;s going to hit in April, it&#8217;s going to hit again in October when energy prices rises seasonally. It&#8217;s going to hit periodically through that period&#8230; So the average household&#8217;s going to end up stiffed for several thousand pounds&#8230; People are going to feel properly poorer &#8212; they&#8217;re going to feel really squeezed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A free market economy [for essential household services] is only going to work if you have a fair market,&#8221; Marsh adds. &#8220;And a fair market is only possible if people can have price transparency, they do have choice of vendors, they can switch between vendors, they can achieve reasonable pricing. So I think that we&#8217;re relatively well served in the UK by the regulatory community.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The UK sectoral regulatory regime is a few years ahead of some of those other contexts [in other countries]. And so once we&#8217;ve got this working here clearly we aspire to taking it internationally but we&#8217;ve got to start somewhere.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: This TechCrunch reporter has known Nous&#8217; CEO, Greg Marsh, since university, when we were (briefly) in the same college subject cohort.

The founding of the smart car BU spurred much speculation over whether Huawei would develop its own cars, though the firm has repeatedly denied any manufacturing plans and said it instead <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/huawei-auto-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wants to be the &#8220;Bosch of China&#8221;<\/a>, or a components supplier for car brands.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274299\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Huawei appears to have adhered to this strategy, at least so far. Last year, the Shenzhen-based company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/huawei-auto-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">showcased its automated driving solutions<\/a> that had been preinstalled in a mass-produced sedan from Arcfox, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/huawei-auto-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a new electric car brand under Chinese automaker BAIC<\/a>. Huawei supplied the electric sedan&#8217;s chipset and in-car operating system.<\/p>\n<p>For VW, a tech firm with autonomous driving capabilities, this could help advance its ambitions to make the vehicles of tomorrow. Indeed, the German giant struck a partnership with Argo AI, a Pittsburg-based startup backed by Ford and VW. Last September, the duo unveiled the first product of their joint effort, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/05\/volkswagen-and-argo-ai-reveal-first-id-buzz-test-vehicle-for-autonomous-driving\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a self-driving electric van<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It would surprise no one that VW was in search of a similar tech partner in China, its <a href=\"https:\/\/annualreport2020.volkswagenag.com\/divisions\/volkswagen-group-china.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest market as of 2020<\/a>. A number of China&#8217;s autonomous vehicle companies have already fostered deep relationships with automakers; Baidu <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/26\/baidus-electric-carmaker-jidu-series-a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has a joint venture with Geely<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/10\/baidu-electric-car-making\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Didi has a JV with BYD<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The reported acquisition comes at a delicate time for Huawei&#8217;s AV team.

Those who will be able to deliver robotaxis will be the ones working on passenger cars. That market is definitely going to be mine, just not yet.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>An acquisition of Huawei&#8217;s autonomous driving business won&#8217;t be cheap.

The firm plans to eventually phase out different loyalty offerings by BigBasket, 1mg and other services, and use NeuCoins universally across all its services.<\/p>\n<p>The rewards is one of the major focuses for Tata Group as it attempts to build a &#8220;connective layer&#8221; for its services that operate in a wide range of categories. If successful, the 155-year-old giant is positioned to conjure up the largest loyalty program in the country.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;TataNeu is a unified platform that connects several brands across the Tata universe like never before. Designed to be a super-app, TataNeu offers everything from daily grocery, electronics, finance solutions, flights, holidays, and more. Each brand on TataNeu is connected by a common reward called NeuCoins, which can be earned across all brands online and at physical locations and can be used similarly as well,&#8221; Tata says.<\/p>\n<p>But customers can accrue NeuCoins by shopping with BigBasket and other Tata services directly and don\u2019t need to use the TataNeu app for it, according to Tata&#8217;s current plan. And the firm, which reaches hundreds of millions of consumers in India, is struggling to get some brands, including Starbucks and others in which its ownership or partnership is limited, to fully or even partially participate in the new loyalty program, according to one person briefed on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>A lot is riding on Tata&#8217;s consumer digital push.

This &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theryanking\/status\/1493390167461224451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">radical<\/a>&#8221; and possibly unprecedented proposal, Breslow explained, promised to give regular employees the same tax benefits in purchasing stock as high-level executives. (Employees who buy their stock earlier theoretically reduce their tax exposure if the value of the stock continues to rise.)<\/p>\n<p>Numerous founders applauded the move, including Harry Hurst, the co-founder and co-CEO of Pipe, a fast-growing outfit that provides upfront capital to companies with recurring revenue streams. &#8220;Yep, no brainer! We did this back in 2020 and it&#8217;s been incredible. It&#8217;s the right thing to do,&#8221; Hurst tweeted.<\/p>\n<p>But many others weighed in to suggest the idea was neither novel nor wise, suggesting that such loans could put employees in a highly precarious financial position should their company&#8217;s shares sink.<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Richards, a managing director of GGV Capital, was among them. Asked yesterday for comment, Richards wrote us in an email, &#8220;Usually I stay out of commenting on founder &#8216;advice&#8217; threads, but on this one I couldn\u2019t remain silent. It is literally one of the worst pieces of advice you can give fellow founders. So many of us have lived through the nightmare scenario of trying to help employees with loans deal with the inevitable downside, it\u2019s just sad. Most importantly, contrary to Ryan\u2019s tweet, it\u2019s not &#8216;new.&#8217; Thousands of companies have done this. There\u2019s a reason good ones don\u2019t do it anymore \u2013 it\u2019s a terrible idea.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Vieje Piauwasdy, the senior director of equity advisory at Secfi, agrees. Secfi is not impartial: it&#8217;s a stock option financing outfit that provides non-recourse loans, wherein it gives money to employees upfront in exchange for a payout later. But Piauwasdy, who previously spent five years with PriceWaterhouseCoopers, calls the kind of loans Breslow is proposing &#8220;insanely risky.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hope that Bolt succeeds,&#8221; Piauwasdy says. &#8220;Ryan wants Bolt to be a pro-employee company. But you can&#8217;t predict the future, and if the stock ends up being worth zero, you&#8217;re still going to owe back that recourse loan in one way, shape, or form.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Breslow, who is 27, predicted in his tweets on Monday that VCs &#8220;will say that this is disaster,\u201d yet his bombastic thread about stock loans for employees seems emblematic of other proposals he has made. Just two weeks ago, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theryanking\/status\/1487500943511932941\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thread<\/a> that also drew both praise and disdain, he wrongly accused the payment company Stripe of exerting control over Y Combinator&#8217;s message board, said that YC is unwilling to fund rivals to Stripe (it has), and called out Lyft as a YC company (it was never part of YC&#8217;s accelerator program).<\/p>\n<p>Following blowback from this tweet storm, Breslow <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/31\/ryanbreslow-bolt\/\">stepped down<\/a> as CEO and became the company\u2019s executive chairman, a move he has said was long in the works.<\/p>\n<p>Breslow clearly has a lot of skin in the game: he reportedly owns a 25% stake in Bolt, which closed on funding at an $11 billion valuation last month, including from such heavyweights as BlackRock, General Atlantic and Willoughby Capital. But it\u2019s hard to see how Breslow\u2019s Twitter game is helping his company\u2019s reputation with customers and investors, who are reportedly investing even more money into the company at a $14 billion valuation.<\/p>\n<p>Breslow&#8217;s latest revelation was likely intended to attract job candidates in what is undeniably a highly challenging market, but it must also send confusing signals to potential hires about who is really in charge at the checkout startup. (You have to wonder what signals it sends to the company\u2019s new CEO, former Amazon executive Maju Kuruvilla, too.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YSaLpXTLoj\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/26\/more-tech-drama-please\/\">More tech drama, please<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;More tech drama, please&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/26\/more-tech-drama-please\/embed\/#?secret=Y4AlY27C3f#?secret=YSaLpXTLoj\" data-secret=\"YSaLpXTLoj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>We asked to speak with Breslow earlier this week and were told he is &#8220;off the grid&#8221; for the time being.

Heading into a long weekend here in the United States, you might think that the news is slowing down but, nope. It\u2019s not. So we have major crypto-football news, European startup analysis, and even some notes on platform dynamics. It\u2019s a busy day, so let\u2019s dive in! \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/super-bowl-ads-boosted-crypto-app-downloads-by-279-led-by-coinbase\/\">Free money is popular<\/a><\/strong>: Alternatively, advertising works. TechCrunch reports that data indicates that the crypto trading ad push during the big American football game led to a spike in downloads for the pertinent companies. Surprised? We\u2019re not, as some of the ads had giveaways attached. Still, a bunch of new folks just got into the crypto game \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to see more in Q1 earnings.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/why-you-shouldnt-ignore-europes-deep-tech-boom\/\">Europe\u2019s deep tech boom<\/a><\/strong>: Diving more deeply into the 2021 startup boom is proving to be good fun, especially as we dial in our focus on key cohorts. Today TechCrunch dug into Europe and the deep tech market, a particular segment of the tech landscape that is often pitched as a U.S.-versus-China battle but could have a third hub, or series of hubs, in the mix.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/circle-to-double-in-value-to-9-billion-with-revamped-spac-deal\/\">See, not all SPACs are falling apart<\/a><\/strong>: The deal to take crypto-focused startup Circle public via a SPAC has dissolved. But wait! It has also been reforged at a far higher price. It\u2019s rare these days to hear positive SPAC news, so the Circle update caught our attention. Read on for more, but stablecoins are proving to be a lucrative way to accrete reserves, it appears.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Startups\/VC<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Before we dive into the day\u2019s startup news digest, a bunch of academics <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/spotify-must-be-more-transparent-about-its-rules-of-the-road\/\">wrote an op-ed for TechCrunch about Spotify, platform dynamics and clarity<\/a>.

The headline? Metriport helps you take your quantified self to the next increment. Even more, the URL of the story ended with the following string: <em>\u200b\u200bmetriport merrily measures your me verse<\/em>. All right, Haje, we get it, you\u2019re clever!<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/voltron-data-grabs-110m-to-build-startup-based-on-apache-arrow-project\/\">$110M to commercialize Apache Arrow<\/a><\/strong>: That\u2019s the news from Voltron Data, which just raised one of the largest Series A rounds that we can recall. How was Voltron able to raise so much money, so quickly? It was founded by \u201cemployees from NVidia, Ursa Computing, BlazingSQL and the co-founder of Apache Arrow,\u201d which we are sure helped. And the company is working to commercialize an open source tool.

And, lately, a little crypto as well. The startup is now offering a way for employees to get paid in stablecoins, which could cut down on currency-related fees, we reckon?<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/beem-an-app-that-lets-you-live-stream-yourself-in-ar-raises-4-million\/\">Beam me up, Beem<\/a><\/strong>: We are all very tired of Zoom calls and other flat-video services because we\u2019ve been chained to them for years now. Beem, however, reckons that we\u2019re not done with <em>all<\/em> video products, so it built a way to \u201clivestream yourself in AR,\u201d as TechCrunch puts it.

The price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but Havenly last raised a $32 million Series C, so we reckon it had the cash on hand for the transaction.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/dutch-raises-20m-to-scale-its-telemedicine-platform-for-pets\/\">Telemedicine for pets<\/a><\/strong>: The boom in remote-doctoring services continues, with Dutch bringing the model to the world of pets.

TechCrunch has been tracking the company for years, curious about its growth and what its rising worth said about its market. Today we&#8217;re revisiting its last private round measured against its most recent financial data. But to do that, we have to do a little background work first.<\/p>\n<p>When Databricks raised <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/31\/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr\/\">a $1.6 billion round last August of 2021<\/a> at a $38 billion post-money valuation, TechCrunch got on the phone with CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alighodsi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ali Ghodsi<\/a> to chat through his company&#8217;s latest mega-raise. We had a few questions.<\/p>\n<p>One of mine was how he felt about the inherent pressure that such a huge private-market valuation would seem to engender &#8212; after all, startup valuations are estimates until they exit, meaning that higher prices mean greater expectations for future success. Ghodsi wasn&#8217;t sweating it.<\/p>\n<p>He said at the time that he didn&#8217;t feel much pressure, and that he was sleeping well.<\/p>\n<p>He gave a few reasons for this. First, per our notes from the conversation, was his belief that his company is really building a new category of service. Second, he hadn&#8217;t maximized for valuation in the fundraising event, and that in both of his company&#8217;s 2021 rounds there was more demand to put capital in than there was room to accept it.<\/p>\n<p>The above is somewhat standard CEO-fare when it comes to startups and unicorns in a hurry. More interesting was his third point, that companies expanding rapidly &#8212; he threw out a 75% growth rate as a talking point &#8212; can surmount market corrections by growth. In simpler terms, if the market changed its tune about the value of software revenues, so long as Databricks kept growing, things would math out just fine.<\/p>\n<p>Well, the market\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/05\/software-stocks-get-punched-in-the-face-again\/\"><em>did<\/em> change<\/a> since that conversation, with the value of software revenue being repriced by the public markets starting in late 2021 and continuing into the early-2022 period. And Databricks kept growing.<\/p>\n<p>So we can have a little fun this afternoon, calculating the company&#8217;s revenue multiples back in August, and at the end of the year using today&#8217;s market data. The experiment will show us how much, if any, ground Databricks has to power through before its private-market valuation can translate on a 1:1 basis to the public markets. I promised myself that I would stop making &#8220;when will Databricks go public jokes,&#8221; so let&#8217;s just get into the math.<\/p>\n<h2>Databricks then, Databricks now<\/h2>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Big-data analytics unicorn Databricks is back in the news, disclosing a new revenue figure and its 2021 growth rate.

Plus, some apps would have likely seen a boost in installs, regardless of their ad spend &#8212; like the sports betting apps or those that had a more practical use, like Peacock and YouTube TV.<\/p>\n<p>But the rank can offer an indication of how popular these brands were before their ad aired.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Oculus was ranked No. 102 Overall on the U.S. iOS App Store on Saturday and only moved to No. 100 on Sunday, then fell even lower on Monday to No. 175, according to data from <a href=\"https:\/\/apptopia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apptopia<\/a>. That shows that even if it saw 25% download growth, as Sensor Tower says, it didn&#8217;t drive a large number of new users to try the app.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase went from No. 124 Overall on Sunday, then crashed due to the huge traffic increase. By Monday, however, it was the No. 2 app on the U.S. App Store. Other top apps on Monday included Peacock TV (No. 1), HBO Max (No. 6), FanDuel Sportsbook (No. 12), DraftKings Sportsbook (No. 25), Disney+ (No. 31) and YouTube TV (No. 42).<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting thing about this year&#8217;s Super Bowl ads, Sensor Tower realized, was that just as these digital brands were embracing traditional TV ads, traditional brands were turning to digital ads.<\/p>\n<p>Per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pathmatics.com\/product\/explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathmatics&#8217; data<\/a>, the top 10 advertisers by spend on over-the-top video platforms like Peacock, Paramount+ and Hulu, were mostly traditional brands. Weight Watchers, for example, spent approximately $1.4 million in marketing on those streaming services, while Volvo and Nike spent $1 million+ and $623,000, respectively. Grocery tracker Basketful &#8212; the only one in the top 10 that was a mobile-first brand &#8212; spent approximately $486,000. It was followed by Geico, which spent around $413,000.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2274072\" style=\"width: 1928px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2274072\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2274072 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1918\" height=\"1110\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png 1918w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png?resize=150,87 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png?resize=300,174 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png?resize=768,444 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png?resize=680,394 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png?resize=1536,889 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/top-ott-advertisers-super-bowl-2022.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1918px) 100vw, 1918px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2274072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Sensor Tower<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Those Super Bowl ad spots paid off for a number of tech companies not just in terms of exposure, but also app installs, a new report indicates.

What was the landscape like for robotic competitions in the U.S. when you founded the organization?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There was no landscape. There were no competitions. So, we\u2019re done with that subject. [\u2026] It\u2019s not about the robots. It\u2019s never been about the robots. Even the tagline for FIRST is \u201cmore than robots.\u201d Thirty years ago, when I started FIRST, it never occurred to me that my goal was to make it about the robots or a robot competition.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>I don\u2019t come up with the taglines, I\u2019m not a marketing guy, but in order to get people to help me, I\u2019d say to them, \u2018we\u2019re not using kids to build robots. We\u2019re using robots to build kids!\u2019 I need a way to compete with the world of sports. The academic world attracts a very small number of people to science, technology and engineering, and typically our culture has mastered the fact that only special, geeky, nerd people can or would like to do math or science.<\/p>\n<p>[\u2026]Thirty years ago, when I started FIRST, it was very simple. I\u2019m not looking to give advantage to the advantaged by finding a new, better way to make a science fair that already attracts the smart kids to make an even bigger gap than the haves and the have nots as technology makes it easier to make more power, more wealth, more capability, leaving everybody further behind. I had exactly the opposite goal. I was afraid that what is now happening would happen, which is, we\u2019re going to have two classes of people: the people who understand how to use the power of technology and will be on that ever-accelerating bus and there will be everyone else that\u2019s under that bus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Another connection with sports is results. You make a thing and it either works or it doesn\u2019t.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yep. And the kids have nobody to blame, and if it works, they can strut around and be proud. The laws of physics are pretty neat, and kids &#8212; no matter what their background &#8212; when they start playing with technology, there are no loopholes. Mother nature is undefeated. You can get around every law we make in our society. But the laws of nature are subtle, but they\u2019re fair, elegant and self-consistent. Kids that come through FIRST start to appreciate the laws of nature and the power of analytical thinking. That\u2019s why we do it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You feel the education gap has only widened in the last 30 years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have dramatically narrowed the gap for all the kids in FIRST programs. Something like 30% of these kids are women, 50% come from Title One schools. We really are successfully going after the right kids to make the biggest difference in their lives. But, the background, everything that I was fearing was happening in our society, the wealth going more and more to those that are the haves and are using technology as a weapon, not as a tool, all of that has, sadly, become a real potential to undermine our whole society. When I first promoted FIRST, it was to be the prevention from that. Now I think it\u2019s the antidote to that. It\u2019s happened, and we\u2019ve got to fix it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FIRST and programs like it are extracurricular. Is there something that can be done to integrate it more directly into the classroom?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a place I would give myself a C- or maybe a D, it\u2019s that when I started FIRST, I got almost all of it right. Make it aspirational, make it after school, make it like every other sport they do &#8212; keep it out of the classroom! The keep it out of the classroom was probably an unnecessary, self-inflicted wound. What I\u2019ve come to realize is, while only a few kids play on the varsity football or basketball team, every kid in school gets to go to gym class and play a little baseball, a little basketball, a little football and get familiar with it.<\/p>\n<p>[\u2026]At the same time we started making it this great, aspirational, after-school fun thing, we should have at least made it available to get a taste of it in the classroom and we didn\u2019t immediately start doing that.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Editor\u2019s note: FIRST <a href=\"https:\/\/info.firstinspires.org\/curriculum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">now offers<\/a> an educational curriculum for in-class learning.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Something a lot of people discuss around robotics and automation is the eventual job loss of blue-collar work.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s nonsense.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/AjIISbARc20?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Is there more that can be done to educate and prepare that workforce?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would ask somebody to find me a single example of a new technology that ended up creating fewer jobs and lesser jobs in terms of enjoyment and pay them. People take a snapshot and think the world is a zero sum game. At some point, there were ditch diggers and you could make a hole to build a house and make a road. It would take a hundred people to make a hole big enough for a house and 10,000 people this long to make a road to go to town and then the bulldozer was invented.<\/p>\n<p>One person might say one bulldozer is going to do the work of 1,000 people with shovels, so a bulldozer is going to put 1,000 people out of work. Well, that would be true if you still needed one short road that went from place to place. But wait, a minute! Now that we have bulldozers, we can build super highways that cross North America in a couple of years. We will more than multiply the opportunity for this. It\u2019s not going to simply replace what we used to do with literally backbreaking work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s the long term and the short term. There will be a job displacement. In your scenario, people who dig ditches don\u2019t necessarily know how to drive a bulldozer. Is there something we can do to accelerate the adoption of higher-tech jobs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You know what we should do? We should create an organization that gives all these people the opportunity break down their unnecessary fear of technology.

I suppose it\u2019s because it\u2019s a bit of niche of a niche at the moment, compared to the world of more traditional farming. But every vertical farming outfit I\u2019ve spoken with (and I\u2019ve spoken with a lot in recent years) has told me that robotics are an integral part of their plans.<\/p>\n<p>It makes sense. Vertically stacked produce is a bit tough for humans to navigate and monitor. Computer vision systems and robotic pickers, on the other hand, can thrive in these environments. Even so, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/16\/following-acquisition-by-bowery-traptics-strawberry-picking-robotics-move-into-vertical-farming\/\">Bowery Farming\u2019s acquisition of former Disrupt Battlefield competitor Traptic<\/a> was something of a surprise. Specifically because it represents a pivot for the Bay Area-based startup, which has thus far focused on strawberry-picking systems for the field.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs of today, Traptic\u2019s technology will be exclusive to Bowery\u2019s network of smart indoor farms,\u201d Traptic co-founder and CEO Lewis Anderson told me. \u201cWe developed our technology to operate in a harsh, outdoor farm environment, and it\u2019s going to work even better indoors. Bowery will be the first indoor farming company to use that Traptic technology.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Traptic\u2019s move away from the field comes at an interesting time for agtech robotics. The interest is certainly there, with farms all over the U.S. dealing with labor shortages. It follows Abundant\u2019s fizzling out and subsequent (well, forthcoming) relaunch under new ownership. The opportunity is certainly there for the right company. Of course, vertical farming is another exciting category, so it should be a fascinating new home for the Traptic team.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2273172\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2273172\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2273172\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg 2088w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg?resize=1536,840 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1120 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-11.40.58-AM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2273172\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Exodigo<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There was a big funding round for Tel Aviv-based Exodigo this week.

Platforms that didn\u2019t think of themselves as social are now faced with managing user content and interaction. In the industry, we would say that Spotify has a \u201cTrust &amp; Safety\u201d problem.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273929\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Spotify, and every other platform with user-generated content, is learning the hard way that they can\u2019t stay out of the way and rely on users to post appropriate content that doesn\u2019t flout company policies or social norms. Platforms are finding that they must become legitimate, active authority figures, not passive publishers. Research shows that they can start by generating trust with users and building expectations of good conduct.<\/p>\n<p>Rogan is just one example. With Spotify\u2019s acquisition of <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.spotify.com\/2021-02-22\/spotifys-anchor-innovations-are-bringing-the-future-of-audio-to-the-present\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anchor<\/a> and its partnership with WordPress, which enable \u201caccess to easier creation of podcasts,\u201d user-generated podcasts discussing politics, health and social issues are part of Spotify\u2019s new frontier.<\/p>\n<p>To this, we can add platform integration: Users can now use Spotify with other platforms, like Facebook, Twitter and Peloton. This means the Spotify user experience is shaped by content created across the internet, on platforms with distinct rules and codes of conduct. Without common industry standards, \u201cmisinformation\u201d at, say, Twitter will not always be flagged by Spotify\u2019s algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the future of social media. Companies once believed they could rely on algorithms to catch inappropriate content and intervene with public relations in high-profile cases. Today, the challenges are bigger and more complicated as consumers redefine where and how one is social online.<\/p>\n<p>Tech companies can adapt by working on two fronts. First, they must establish themselves as legitimate authorities in the eyes of their community. This starts by making the rules readily available, easily understandable and applicable to all users.<\/p>\n<p>Think of this as the rules of driving, another large-scale system that works by ensuring people know the rules and can share a common understanding of traffic lights and rights of way. Simple reminders of the rules, like stop signs, can be highly effective. In experiments with Facebook users, reminding people about rules decreased the likelihood of ongoing bad behavior. To create safety on platforms facing thousands, if not millions, of users, a company must similarly build out clear, understandable procedures.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Try to find Spotify\u2019s rules. We couldn\u2019t. Imagine driving without stop signs or traffic lights. It\u2019s hard to follow the rules if you can\u2019t find them. Tech companies have historically been resistant to being responsible authority figures. The earliest efforts in Silicon Valley at managing user content were spam fighting teams that blocked actors who hacked their systems for fun and profit. They legitimately believed that by disclosing the rules, users would game the platform and that people would change behavior only when they are punished.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tTry to find Spotify\u2019s rules. We couldn\u2019t. Imagine driving without stop signs or traffic lights. It\u2019s hard to follow the rules if you can\u2019t find them.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We call this approach \u201cdeterrence,\u201d which works for adversarial people like spammers. It is not so effective for more complicated rule-breaking behaviors, like racist rants, misinformation and incitement of violence. Here, purveyors are not necessarily motivated by money or the love of hacking. They have a cause, and they may see themselves as rightfully expressing an opinion and building a community.<\/p>\n<p>To influence the content of these users, companies need to drop reactive punishment and instead take up proactive governance \u2014 set standards, reward good behavior and, when necessary, enforce rules swiftly and with dignity to avoid the perception of being arbitrary authority figures.<\/p>\n<p>The second key step is to be transparent with the community and set clear expectations for appropriate behavior. Transparency means disclosing what the company is doing, and how well it is doing, to keep things safe. The effect of reinforcing so-called \u201cplatform norms\u201d is that users understand how their actions could impact the wider community. The Joe Rogans of the world start to appear less attractive as people look at them as threatening the safe, healthy experience of the wider community.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re defining an entirely new space of tech and media,\u201d Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek said in a recent employee meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re a very different kind of company, and the rules of the road are being written as we innovate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s just not true. Sorry, Spotify, but you are not that special. There are already proven \u201crules of the road\u201d for technology platforms \u2014 rules that show great promise for building trust and safety. The company just needs to accept them and follow them.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll still have incidents of online \u201croad rage\u201d once in a while, but the public might just be more forgiving when it happens.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Companies once believed they could rely on algorithms to catch inappropriate content and intervene with public relations in high-profile cases.

Automated food prep is going to be a big thing, going forward. Many predicted as much in the early days of the pandemic, when stay at home orders and fears around COVID transmission left many restaurant owners wondering how much of the process they might eventually be able to automate.<\/p>\n<p>I suspect many thought that would be something of a temporary issue. Two years into the pandemic, it\u2019s probably safe to say our expectations for \u201ctemporary\u201d have shifted some what. But even as spikes have died down in certain areas, finding staff for often low-paying food service work continues to be an issue.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, we\u2019ve seen a lot of investment interest around companies promising to help automate industrial kitchens. That side of the equation is starting to catch up to the level of excitement that\u2019s surrounded robotic food delivery for several years now. We\u2019re going to see special attention paid to certain food types at the beginning, due to the relative ease with which they can be automated. Pizza has been an obvious first choice for a while, due to its simplicity and the fact that, well, most people like pizza.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2274009\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Salads and bowls are a good candidate, too.

That latter detail is an interesting one, as many of these companies position automation as outward facing. Depending on how you look at it, you may consider a robot making your lunch a cool &#8212; or, at the very least, novel &#8212; idea.

The round, led by Tiger Global, brings its total funding to $34.4 million. This latest round will be used for the sorts of things you\u2019d expect robotics funding to be used for, including additional R&amp;D, building out a production facility and expanding into more markets.

The episode was nearing the end, and Unit CEO and co-founder Itai Damti had just explained how the company&#8217;s long-running Culture and Values document helped pitch the company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d seen, obviously, high-level values in culture documents with bullet points and whatnot &#8212; but nothing to this level of specificity or commitment. &#8230; Of course, it expanded over time, but you get a real sense of how he&#8217;s planning to lead, particularly across two different headquarters and how Unit scales. I think it&#8217;s impressive. It&#8217;s important for [Flourish Ventures].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Damti explained the document (embedded below).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we were just two people before we even knew what we would do, we sat down and wrote a half-page on the type of environment we wanted to build. The same Google Doc we started back then is the doc we use today, but it&#8217;s grown to 11 pages. It touches on many, many pieces of learning that we accumulated over time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/17\/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform\/\">Unit<\/a> raised its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service\/\">Series A<\/a> in 2020 when COVID prevented face-to-face meetings with investors. &#8220;It was important for us to give people a window into how we execute as a team, and this document gave them a chance to almost spend an hour in the office without being in the office with us. The best way to do it was to share what was then a seven- or eight-page book on culture and values.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This got us a lot of excitement from investors,&#8221; Damti said. &#8220;We do it because it&#8217;s important for the business. We do it to set expectations with employee candidates. And this is something constitutional in the company that drives how we execute. I also found that one of the cool byproducts was taking this asset and sharing it with people I know. Some people would keep it confidential. I was, like, &#8216;Investors should get a window into how the company thinks.&#8217; And that&#8217;s always been important.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unit CEO and co-founder Itai Damti broke down the company&#8217;s pitch deck with investor Emmalyn Shaw.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24986667,"featured_media":2274029,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"01201f8b-96ff-3ff1-8c01-6825440c6a0a"},"categories":[17396],"tags":[576848238,576856383,576852219,576638748,576926875,576754943,576887617],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796352],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/TCL-2022-february-16.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3rWLqxz","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.31,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[24986667],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/units-itai-damti-explains-how-the-company-fundraises-using-culture-and-value\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273878"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2273878"}],"version-history":[{"count":24,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273878\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2274082,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273878\/revisions\/2274082"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/24986667"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2273878&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/24986667"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2274029"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2273878"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2273878"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2273878"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2273878"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2273878"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2273878"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2273878"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2273986,"date":"2022-02-17T09:11:39","date_gmt":"2022-02-17T17:11:39","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/?p=2273986"},"modified":"2022-02-17T09:11:39","modified_gmt":"2022-02-17T17:11:39","slug":"elon-musk-accuses-sec-of-conducting-a-harassment-campaign","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/elon-musk-accuses-sec-of-conducting-a-harassment-campaign\/","title":{"rendered":"Elon Musk accuses SEC of conducting a &#8216;harassment campaign&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<div class=\"article__contributor-byline-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"article__contributor-byline\">\n\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__contributor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"byline__author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-name\">Jon Fingas<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-title\" style=\"display: block;\">Contributor<\/span>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\tJon Fingas is a contributing writer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\">Engadget<\/a>.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__more-articles\">\n\t\t<span class=\"more-articles-title\">More posts by this contributor<\/span>\n\t\t<ul class=\"more-articles-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/fords-mustang-mach-e-ousts-the-tesla-model-3-as-consumer-reports-top-ev\/\">Ford&#8217;s Mustang Mach-E ousts the Tesla Model 3 as Consumer Reports&#8217;

There haven&#8217;t been any findings of wrongdoing, according to the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>Musk and Tesla asked the court for a &#8220;course correction&#8221; including a conference to discuss the SEC&#8217;s alleged failure to pay as well as the frequent investigations. They hoped the court would put the claimed harassment &#8220;to an end&#8221; while forcing the SEC to pay shareholders.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273986\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve asked the SEC for comment. The government body has made repeated inquiries into Musk&#8217;s tweets in the years since the settlement, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/musk-tweets-232821629.html\" data-ylk=\"elm:context_link;itc:0\" data-rapid_p=\"22\" data-v9y=\"1\">writing Tesla in 2019 and 2020<\/a> over posts it found concerning. While it&#8217;s true the SEC hasn&#8217;t found Musk at fault for those tweets, officials still claimed Musk was discussing key financial topics (such as production levels and stock valuations) without the pre-approval required under the 2018 agreement. Tesla argued these tweets weren&#8217;t covered under the terms of the deal, but it&#8217;s safe to say the situation isn&#8217;t entirely clear-cut.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:<\/strong> <em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/elon-musk-tesla-complaint-against-sec-144655620.html\">Engadget<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you thought Elon Musk was upset about frequent attention from the SEC&#8230; you guessed correctly.

There&#8217;s a challenge, though: If you&#8217;re an obsessive tracker, you are running half a dozen apps that don&#8217;t talk to each other, and spotting patterns in the data can be hard. Does your period affect how sore you are after running? Does your mood affect how much you eat? Is there a correlation between how much coffee you drink or how much you walk and the quality of your sleep? Metriport can track it and lift the veil on patterns that hitherto were opaque.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We see this as the Swiss Army knife of tracking apps. Gone are the days where you need seven different apps for tracking &#8212; one for mood tracking, one for journaling, one for period tracking, one for health &#8212; With Metriport we put it all together in one privacy focused-platform, built around the concept of your personal data dashboard,&#8221; says Colin Elsinga, co-founder at Metriport. &#8220;So far, we built Metriport with no outside investment. My friend Dima and I have known each other since middle school; we are both developers and we&#8217;ve had a passion for health and fitness &#8212; mental health, especially. We were both using a lot of different tracking apps, and found them quite limiting.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273917\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The company is rejecting using ad tracking technologies, and stores all user data encrypted and locally on the device &#8212; even the developers can&#8217;t get to your data.

You can opt out of that if you don&#8217;t want your data on our servers, and in any case, it is all encrypted.

We are working on a lot of exciting new features: In fact, we pushed an update live today that includes weather tracking.

The group came together to build a company on top of Arrow to help companies that don&#8217;t want to deal with the headaches of managing an open source project on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Voltron Data co-founder and CEO Josh Patterson said that at its heart, the startup is a standards company that aims to spread the word on the power of data and analytics standardization via Apache Arrow.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is to take the existing data analytics ecosystem and improve it based on standards. And we&#8217;ve seen this time and time again in other industries when standards emerge, they become accelerators, enabling more efficient things to happen to make the community as a whole better by building these common building blocks. And we&#8217;re about bringing modularity and composability to the data analytics ecosystem,&#8221; Patterson explained.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273921\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The standards part is where Apache Arrow comes into play. The project <a href=\"https:\/\/arrow.apache.org\/faq\/\">website FAQ<\/a> describes it thusly: &#8220;Apache Arrow is a software development platform for building high performance applications that process and transport large data sets. It is designed to both improve the performance of analytical algorithms and the efficiency of moving data from one system (or programming language) to another.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Patterson said that as data and analytics have evolved, developers have had to connect to a growing number of systems across a variety of languages. It&#8217;s a huge challenge, one that Arrow is trying to solve. &#8220;What if I wanted to connect this system and that system? I don&#8217;t want to rewrite all the glue code to make it happen. And that&#8217;s really what Arrow does very well. Arrow has become this de facto standard for connecting systems together,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The open source tool has proved amazingly popular, with the company reporting more than 42 million downloads per month.

The company has garnered $110 million in seed and A money, a huge amount, even by today&#8217;s inflated investments.<\/p>\n<p>Patterson said that his company took the money for a practical reason. The problem they are trying to solve is difficult and multi-faceted, and they need to invest to accelerate as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want [the open source growth] to hit this stagnation point where it&#8217;s [only well suited] for power users and experts, but it&#8217;s not conducive for this next wave of users and systems builders and library builders. We want to figure out where the pain points are, so we can build more tooling and libraries around that, and be even more readily available,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The company is working on its first commercial product. While Patterson was not quite ready to talk about it in detail yet, it will involve a managed version of Apache Arrow for that second group that may not want to deal with the raw open source.<\/p>\n<p>With a distributed workforce, the company already has almost 100 employees and is actively hiring. For Patterson, who is Black, building a diverse and inclusive company is top of mind. &#8220;Inclusivity is really important to us, and we&#8217;re seeing that as we&#8217;ve had new employees across the spectrum of race, gender and sexual orientation coming to Voltron Data feeling like they can be heard, feeling empowered,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>From a pure numbers perspective, he said they have 20% African American, 15% Hispanic, 15% Asian and roughly 20% women, adding that as the company grows, they are continually working to improve diversity across the board.<\/p>\n<p>The funding breaks down to a $22 million seed round and an $88 million Series A. The A round was led by Walden Catalyst with participation from BlackRock, Anthos Capital, Battery Ventures, Coatue, GV, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nepenthe Capital, Redline and The Factory.

Then it\u2019s delivered to your home in a few days. The \u201cnative retail\u201d startup announced today that it has raised $5 million in seed funding led by Accel.<\/p>\n<p>The company was founded by Marc Hostovsky and Shobhit Khandelwal, who worked together at Jet.com before the e-commerce marketplace was acquired by Walmart in 2016. During that time, Hostovsky worked closely with omnichannel teams \u2014 for example, e-commerce in Hoboken and San Bruno and the Stores team in Bentonville.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI realized pretty quickly that the best product experiences don\u2019t happen on screens or shelves but instead happen \u2018in the wild,\u2019\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIn real moments where you\u2019d actually use the product to assess whether you like something or not.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273649\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>In late 2019, he stayed at an Airbnb and \u201cbecame completely enamored with the furnishings. The bed was so comfortable, the knives were perfectly sharp and the host had done an amazing job optimizing counter space in the small kitchen.\u201d Hostovsky and his partner lived in a small New York City apartment, so they took a lot of photos to replicate how the Airbnb space was laid out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen I sort of had this funny realization,\u201d Hostovsky said, \u201c\u2019Huh\u2026 brands are spending billions of dollars on Facebook and Google ads just trying to get their products in front of consumers and here we are having an authentic experience with these products enough to feel inspired to buy it when we leave.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As it happens, Hostovsky left his job at Walmart to work at Minoan right before the pandemic hit the U.S. \u201cWhat a time to take a leap and start a company at the intersection of hospitality and physical retail, two industries that were getting decimated,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>During the first two months of the company, travel was at a standstill, but gradually started picking back up by summer 2020. One of Minoan\u2019s largest markets, the Hamptons, actually had a very busy season, with most of its short-term rental partners near 100% occupancy and charging higher rates due to demand.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe way people traveled changed but people started traveling again,\u201d said Hostovsky. \u201cI think the large push for flexible\/remote work will result in a culture where \u2018personal travel\u2019 and \u2018work\u2019 aren\u2019t oil and water anymore, and that\u2019s where an experience like Minoan fits nicely between consumer and business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2273652\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2273652\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2273652\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"Minoan co-founders Marc Hostovsky and Shobhit Khandelwal\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg?resize=768,1025 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg?resize=1151,1536 1151w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IMG_6634.jpg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2273652\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Minoan co-founders Marc Hostovsky and Shobhit Khandelwal. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Minoan<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Minoan partners with about 160 products brands, including Pottery Barn, Crate&amp;Barrel, Society6 and Apotheke. Aside from providing an additional distribution channel, Hostovsky said working with Minoan can build brand loyalty. Most guests stay in Minoan spaces for three to four days and during that time, they are using products from Minoan partners every day. Then Minoan\u2019s tech gives them an easy way to buy those products and also collect reviews.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value to be captured there, especially in a time when only 9% of digital ads are viewed for more than one second,\u201d said Hostovsky.<\/p>\n<p>Minoan currently has about 80 property partners, encompassing 1,800 spaces. This includes a network of more than 40 hotels, including properties like William Vale in Brooklyn, Lokal Hotels and Mint House 70 Pine. It is also focused on short-term rental properties listed on sites like Airbnb and Vrbo. The company operates throughout the United States, but has large groups of property partners in states like Texas, New York, California, Colorado, Tennessee and Ohio. Part of the funding will be used to expand Minoan\u2019s geographical presence.<\/p>\n<p>For Minoan\u2019s property partners, the company gives them a way to furnish spaces at below retail prices, which Hostovsky said many pay because of the hassle of purchasing wholesale. \u201cNot only is it expensive, but it\u2019s labor intensive, and if you\u2019re an individual owner, it\u2019s a huge burden,\u201d he said. Minoan lets them save over 30% on items, plus they can earn a commission on whatever sells in their space, with Minoan taking care of the administrative side of the retail process. \u201cWe have a custom-built procurement platform where properties can search, purchase and track everything they need in one digital space,\u201d Hostovsky said. \u201cTypically, you\u2019re doing this through each individual store you buy products from, but at Minoan we house all that in one portal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Part of the new funding will be used on hiring in India, where Khandelwal is from. Minoan has offices in Hyderbad and Delhi there. \u201cThey\u2019ll lead technology and product development across different elements of the platform,\u201d Khandelwal said. \u201cWe are building our entire tech org in India, so it\u2019s not a back office but our front office from a technology and innovation perspective. Everyone in the India team gets equity and salaries similar to the business folks in North America.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Accel partner Dan Levine said, \u201cRetail has changed drastically over the last 10 years, and the way people shop has been the most disrupted. What drew us to Minoan was their end to end approach to retail, which typically companies are either consumer or business focused; Minoan has created an end-to-end native retail model that benefits both. We at Accel\u00a0believe\u00a0this format will blend the online\/offline experience more than ever before and create better, more trusting shopping experiences consumers are demanding.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"V3QGMATtMY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/16\/welcome-to-the-post-pandemic-economy-startups\/\">Welcome to the post-pandemic economy, startups<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Welcome to the post-pandemic economy, startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/16\/welcome-to-the-post-pandemic-economy-startups\/embed\/#?secret=7tR5ay85KD#?secret=V3QGMATtMY\" data-secret=\"V3QGMATtMY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fh7syIJWxg\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/13\/as-e-commerce-booms-during-the-pandemic-shopify-accelerates\/\">As e-commerce booms during the pandemic, Shopify accelerates<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;As e-commerce booms during the pandemic, Shopify accelerates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/13\/as-e-commerce-booms-during-the-pandemic-shopify-accelerates\/embed\/#?secret=WKT1t5EG3A#?secret=fh7syIJWxg\" data-secret=\"fh7syIJWxg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Imagine staying at an Airbnb and becoming so attached to a particular chair or tea set that you want to buy it.

Straubel said the program will be free for those turning in vehicle batteries. The cost of retrieving, properly packaging and then transporting the batteries back to Redwood&#8217;s recycling facility in northern Nevada will be shared by the startup along with partners Volvo and Ford. Redwood will accept all lithium-ion and nickel metal hydride batteries in the state, regardless of the make or model of the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is messy right now and there&#8217;s not a great, you know, obvious, clear solution to people,&#8221; Straubel said. &#8220;That is a really key part of what we want to change and make it as easy as humanly possible, for everyone in the United States initially, and in the world more broadly to, very simply recycle batteries and make sure those materials are recovered in very high percentage.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273661\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Redwood has <a href=\"https:\/\/forms.office.com\/Pages\/ResponsePage.aspx?id=uIPKy3GpqEOas84lmf8S6hhYQJe3OW9FqBkZ5yFpYkJUQUlTNThYVzZMOE1WU01ERTdYNTRIVUZOWCQlQCN0PWcu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched a portal<\/a> that scrapyards and dealers can use to organize the retrieval of the batteries.<\/p>\n<p>The pilot program is still at an early stage with some pieces not clearly defined.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to emphasize that we are learning in all of this and, you know, it&#8217;s a bit of the Wild West,&#8221; Straubel said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s maybe partly why some of these things haven&#8217;t been more formalized today because it is a bit complex.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Redwood was launched in 2017 with an aim to\u00a0create a circular supply chain. The company recycles scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers, including Amazon, Ford and AESC Envision in Tennessee.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The aim is to create a closed-loop system that will ultimately help reduce the cost of batteries and offset the need for mining.<\/p>\n<p>Electric vehicles on the road today are equipped with lithium-ion batteries. A battery contains two electrodes. There&#8217;s an anode (negative) on one side and a cathode (positive) on the other.

But China and the United States are far from the only technology markets with developed startup and incumbent cohorts, strong venture capital activity, and capital markets able to translate early-stage ideas into public companies.<\/p>\n<p>The AI race is part of a larger deep technology competition that includes things like chip fabrication, another flashpoint often discussed as a U.S-China issue. The reality is that many countries are betting on deep tech &#8212; what The Exchange considers investment into complex technology that may lack immediate commercial application, or is focused on laying the groundwork for other, more market-friendly products.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Read it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\">every morning on TechCrunch+<\/a> or get <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">The Exchange newsletter<\/a> every Saturday.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>We\u2019re curious if Europe can form a third, independent center or group of hubs for deep tech investment, IP and company creation that&#8217;s separate from China and the United States.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re approaching the question in two parts: Today, we\u2019re analyzing <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/angularventures\/enterprise-deep-tech-vc-in-europe-israel-2021-43b35512f43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Angular Ventures\u2019 report on VC investment<\/a> into enterprise and deep tech in Europe and Israel. Then, early next week, we\u2019ll collect commentary on the question from leading European investors and founders to better understand the on-the-ground perspective.<\/p>\n<h2>Rising totals<\/h2>\n<p>To start, a few caveats. The Angular Ventures report includes data from Israel, an active deep tech market. And what the venture firm has put together is inclusive of some enterprise investment (SaaS, fintech, e-commerce and so forth). So we\u2019re going to need to do some parsing, but no data set is perfect, and what Angular published is very useful.<\/p>\n<p>The first data point that we need to consider is focus. Angular divides venture capital activity into two buckets that are useful for broad comparisons. If we observe the venture capital market of Europe from an enterprise and deep tech versus consumer perspective, data indicate that the continent has radically changed its investment focus from balance to a preponderance of non-consumer work.<\/p>\n<p>From 2014 through 2017, for example, the two broad categories were roughly matched, each holding around 50% of venture activity in Europe. But in 2018 through today, that parity shifted to a roughly two-thirds\/one-third split, with European deep tech and enterprise investment taking the majority of deal flow.<\/p>\n<p>That recent and sharp divergence in venture focus on Europe helps explain why our question is more than idle. Europe has evolved from a market that was pretty evenly split between consumer and non-consumer investments toward one that is heavily biased in favor of back-end tech over consumer-facing products.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re curious if Europe can form a third, independent center or group of hubs for deep tech investment, IP and company creation that&#8217;s separate from China and the United States.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574450,"featured_media":1996011,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"84403340-13ac-3381-bc06-0d8daadc99c6"},"categories":[60523764,20429,17396,35394854],"tags":[576713183,449559189,576858236,576847237,576860890,576866652,576765839],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353,576796356],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRY2.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3gYuXCs","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.39,"featured":true,"subtitle":"The continent is moving away from consumer VC investment, new data show","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024,133574450],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/why-you-shouldnt-ignore-europes-deep-tech-boom\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273848"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2273848"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273848\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2273910,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2273848\/revisions\/2273910"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574450"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2273848&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574450"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1996011"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2273848"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2273848"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2273848"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2273848"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2273848"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2273848"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2273848"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2273840,"date":"2022-02-17T07:01:52","date_gmt":"2022-02-17T15:01:52","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/?p=2273840"},"modified":"2022-02-17T09:05:46","modified_gmt":"2022-02-17T17:05:46","slug":"snapchat-change-username","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/17\/snapchat-change-username\/","title":{"rendered":"Snapchat will let you change your username starting February 23"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.snapchat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snapchat<\/a> users will be able to change their usernames later this month, the company announced on Thursday.

A Snapchat spokesperson told TechCrunch that this feature is already in very early beta for a small set of U.S.-based creators, but the platform plans to roll it out more broadly to Snap Stars in the coming months. These advertisements will appear as mid-roll ads inside their stories, and the creator will earn a share of the ad revenue.

Cities like San Antonio, Los Angeles and, most recently, Las Vegas, have used these capabilities to address access to first- and last-mile transportation, a common problem in most cities that are still mainly run by fixed-route transit systems.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273582\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5fxS0fizUC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/02\/vias-remix-launches-tool-for-cities-to-plan-on-demand-and-fixed-route-transit-together\/\">Cities have a new planning tool to fold ride-sharing into public transit systems<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Cities have a new planning tool to fold ride-sharing into public transit systems&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/02\/vias-remix-launches-tool-for-cities-to-plan-on-demand-and-fixed-route-transit-together\/embed\/#?secret=req3lfkvTP#?secret=5fxS0fizUC\" data-secret=\"5fxS0fizUC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Take San Antonio, for example,&#8221; Gururajan told TechCrunch. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got certain areas of the city that are well-served by transit because they have high density, whereas there are many other parts of the city where there is low density, and they have first- and last-mile access problems. Fixed-route transit just does not work there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dynamic shuttles and buses that actually go to the places where people are ordering rides and where they want to be dropped off can solve those problems and create more mobility in a city.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So what you have now is a city where with our service, they can use dynamic transit in the medium- and low-density areas that feed into the high-frequency corridors where they have lightrail transit or express bus lanes and where they have the demand to fill up the buses.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Passengers can view their vehicle on the app and can book rides in advance, in real time or even recurring, such as every day of the work week at 9 am.<\/p>\n<p>RideCo&#8217;s Series A, which was led by Eclipse Ventures, represents the first time the company has raised institutional investment in the seven years since its founding. Gururajan attributes this to a couple of factors, the first being that RideCo spent the first couple of years heads down on building out its core technology and testing it with some beta customers to solve certain use cases.<\/p>\n<p>When RideCo was ready to bring its product to market, it realized it didn&#8217;t quite have product-market fit yet.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we went to market, we found there were some clients interested in this, but as a whole, the market wasn&#8217;t ready yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were still apprehensive about anything that was app-driven transportation, but all that started changing around the end of 2018. We had a couple of big city sign-ups, like San Antonio, that knocked it out of the park in terms of saving money for the agency and improving mobility for the residents.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Since then, RideCo has found its way into cities across the U.S. and Canada, from big cities like Calgary and Houston to small towns like Cobourg, Ontario. The pandemic also accelerated RideCo&#8217;s growth as transit agencies began to think of new ways to flex to riders changing demand patterns and desire for modernized and responsive networks, said Gururajan.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last year, RideCo&#8217;s customer base has grown 2x, although the company did not say what the base of that growth was.<\/p>\n<p>RideCo is ramping up its offering of on-demand transit at a time when its main competitor, Via, is diversifying its offering and identifying more as an overall transit tech provider than an on-demand transit provider. The two companies, both of whom filed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/rideco-brings-patent-infringement-claims-against-via-transportation-and-responds-to-vias-meritless-lawsuit-301342574.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">patent infringement lawsuits<\/a> against each other last year for the similarities between their tech, were founded in the same year, yet Via has captured far more market share than its Canadian counterpart.<\/p>\n<p>RideCo might still be able to carve out some market share in this nascent industry.<a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.masstransitmag.com\/files\/base\/cygnus\/mass\/document\/2021\/02\/MobilityReport2021_finalonline.602c399f0db9b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Almost 16% of transit agencies in the U.S. and Canada already offer on-demand transit<\/a>, and that number is expected to continue to rise with other forms of shared mobility.

The company is also backed by a long list of founder angel investors such as Affirm\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Levchin, Plaid\u2019s William Hockey, Unit\u2019s Itai Damti, Flexport\u2019s Ryan Petersen, Marqeta\u2019s Jason Gardner and Alloy\u2019s Laura Spiekerman and Tommy Nicholas, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in late 2020 by Daniel Simon, Coast describes itself as the \u201cmodern financial services platform for the future of transportation.&#8221; It compares itself to the likes of Ramp, Brex or Airbase in that it has developed an expense management software platform for fleet operators and their employees. To that end, and like the aforementioned spend management companies, Coast has created a commercial charge card designed for the businesses that operate vehicle fleets, such as trucking companies, plumbers, HVAC businesses or last-mile delivery companies.<\/span><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273503\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, fleets have turned to specialized fleet and fuel credit cards that provide controls like restricting purchases to only fuel products of a particular grade or tracking expenses on a per-vehicle basis. But Simon argues that the companies that sell such cards were founded decades ago with very little innovation since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most also require a driver to refuel at certain gas stations and do not allow the operator to customize spending controls or see transactions in real time,\u201d he told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coast\u2019s goal is to use technology to provide fleet business owners and their employees payments products that are intuitive and easy to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFleets like these have data needs that corporate cards don&#8217;t provide,\u201d said Simon. \u201cThey need detailed visibility at the line-item level into their employees\u2019 spending.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And, they need their employee and vehicle payments integrated into the rest of their operations.\u201d<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, he added, they might want to know how many gallons of which fuel grade are being bought for which vehicle or want to make sure that their employees\u2019 spending complies with company policies when those workers are in the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conjunction with the funding announcement, Coast also revealed it has teamed up with Visa to launch a Visa Fleet card program, so that Coast Visa Fleet cardholders can make payments at North American merchants wherever Visa is accepted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This new collaboration, according to Simon, allows drivers to use the card to purchase fuel nearly anywhere it is sold. It also allows managers to permit drivers to pay for other business expenses, such as parking or maintenance, and to manage them all through a single platform.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coast\u2019s interchangeable cards, which allow drivers and vehicles to share physical cards while still providing \u201cfine-grained visibility and control,\u201d are designed to simplify the administration process of running a fleet expenses program. Also, the company\u2019s SMS-based mobile sign-in and data collection is aimed at improving security, convenience for drivers and data quality for managers, Simon said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon previously co-founded consumer finance startup Bread, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/alliance-data-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-bread-301162702.htmlhttps:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/alliance-data-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-bread-301162702.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sold to Alliance Data Systems for over $500 million<\/a> in 2020. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wants to bring the \u201csame sort of ease of use and transparency that Bread brought to e-commerce consumers and retailers to a category of business and employee that is often overlooked in tech.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EMXPmWm1KI\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/07\/after-selling-bread-last-year-for-over-500m-founder-sets-out-to-build-the-financial-platform-for-the-future-of-transportation\/\">After selling Bread last year for over $500M, this founder just raised millions for his new fintech startup<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;After selling Bread last year for over $500M, this founder just raised millions for his new fintech startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/07\/after-selling-bread-last-year-for-over-500m-founder-sets-out-to-build-the-financial-platform-for-the-future-of-transportation\/embed\/#?secret=d3ilYnvD0w#?secret=EMXPmWm1KI\" data-secret=\"EMXPmWm1KI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for its business model, Coast earns <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interchange fees from the merchant when its customers use the Coast card to make purchases. It also charges customers a flat subscription fee of $2 per month per employee who use the cards to make payments that month. It also offers a 2\u00a2 rebate for customers for every gallon that they buy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Presently, Coast has around 20 employees, compared to three a year ago, and wants to grow its team to about 60 by year\u2019s end. It also plans to use the funding toward expanding the platform\u2019s capabilities and offer a wider range of financial products to fleet operators. In particular, it wants to expand its product line beyond payments for fuel and into other categories of commercial spend that field employees need to make on behalf of businesses, such as parking, maintenance and other on-the-road expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coast is focused on expanding its existing footprint with businesses in the United States that operate vehicle fleets across a broad range of industries, including trucking; home services trades like electrical, plumbing, pest control and HVAC; and transportation, delivery and others.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe company\u2019s goal today is to provide the best possible solution for small and medium-sized businesses, from as few as half a dozen vehicles all the way up to a couple hundred vehicles, but its software scales to serve the needs of much larger enterprise fleets,\u201d Simon said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insight Partners\u2019 Rebecca Liu-Doyle believes the next wave of spend management will include solutions that are focused on solving category-specific pain points with \u201cpurpose-built\u201d capabilities across both workflow and payments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDaniel and Coast have all the right ingredients \u2014 they are focused on solving the pain of fleet operators with an elegant user-centric approach,\u201d she added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accel Partner Amit Kumar notes that fleets are \u201ca disproportionately large segment\u201d of all domestic B2B spend and yet have been underserved by modern financial products and services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCoast\u2019s fintech pedigree and sophistication have allowed them to adapt the corporate card innovation we\u2019re seeing in other market segments for fleet operators,\u201d he wrote via email.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My weekly fintech newsletter is launching soon!

At the same time, it has reached a new deal with Concord Acquisition Corp. for a new merger. If the transaction goes through, Circle would become a public company at a $9 billion valuation.<\/p>\n<p>Originally announced in July 2021, the merger was supposed to close in Q4 2021. And it sounds like Circle wasn\u2019t satisfied with its original deal that valued Circle at $4.5 billion. The company didn\u2019t wait until the termination date of April 3, 2022 to scrap it and sign a new deal.<\/p>\n<p>Circle is better known as one of the founding members of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.centre.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centre consortium<\/a> with Coinbase. This consortium is in charge of managing USD Coin (USDC), a popular stablecoin. At any point in time, one USDC is always worth one USD.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273838\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It is backed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1824301\/000110465921108633\/tm2125702d2_425.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exclusively<\/a> by cash, cash equivalent and short-duration U.S. Treasuries. Those reserves are regularly checked by auditing firms. This way, you aren&#8217;t exposed to crypto volatility but you can send and receive money from one wallet to another using code \u2014 it works like any regular cryptocurrency transaction.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, USDC is available on several different blockchains. Each blockchain provides different advantages and drawbacks depending on what you\u2019re looking for when it comes to fees, speed and convenience. USDC is currently available on Ethereum, Algorand, Solana, Stellar, Tron, Hedera, Avalanche and Flow.<\/p>\n<p>And USDC usage is growing rapidly. In July 2021, Circle said that there were $25 billion worth of USDC in circulation. That figure has more than doubled as USDC circulation has reached $52.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to reserve-related incomes, Circle provides several APIs and yield-generating products. For instance, the company helps you process payments and trigger payouts with simple API calls. It is compatible with many classic payment methods, such as card payments, bank wires and ACH.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Developers can take advantage of those services to create on- and off-ramps for their crypto products. And those \u201ctransaction and treasury services\u201d, as Circle calls its API services, are generating most of Circle\u2019s revenue. Some companies using Circle\u2019s transaction and treasury services <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2021\/07\/08\/usdc-is-only-circles-second-biggest-business-spac-filing-shows\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">include<\/a> Dapper Labs, Compound Labs and FTX.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, Circle started offering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.circle.com\/en\/products\/yield\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle Yield<\/a>. Companies using Circle Yield can generate fixed interests through short-term investments that range from one to 12 months. It\u2019s also worth noting that Circle owns <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seedinvest.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SeedInvest<\/a>, an equity crowdfunding platform.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see if Circle finally goes public with this new deal. As TechCrunch\u2019s Alex Wilhelm <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/08\/circle-is-a-good-example-of-why-spacs-can-be-useful\/\">wrote<\/a> last year, Circle still thinks it has a lot of growth potential ahead.

Technically, Ibex is a registered investment adviser, although it is not an investment banker. Ibex does have dedicated VC funds, including a $100 million early-stage fund focused on Israel-based startups across all sectors, an Israel-focused hedge fund and a mobility-focused hedge fund that trades mostly in equities. Ibex also makes select one-off investments in later-stage mobility startups <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/10\/electric-moped-startup-revel-raises-27-6-million-as-it-eyes-new-markets\/\">such as Revel<\/a>. In all, the firm has about $1.2 billion in assets under management.<\/p>\n<p>This latest fund has a dedicated focus on early-stage mobility startups, but it&#8217;s not restricted to Israel or any other geography. That opens Ibex to a whole new swath of mobility startups.<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Peters, who recently joined Ibex after a stint at Autotech Ventures, said the fund is looking for startups in sharing and connectivity, electrification and autonomy.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of ground to cover. Ibex has kicked off this fund with two investments. One is into Aifleet, an Austin-based startup that has developed software to eliminate wait times for trucking; the other is an investment into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visionary.ai\/\">Visionary.ai<\/a>, an Israeli digital imaging processor company. Borus told TechCrunch that he believes trucking will be among the first sectors to be disrupted by autonomous vehicle technology.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Marc El Khoury, the co-founder and CEO of Aifleet, said he was drawn to Ibex, in part, because of the company&#8217;s limited partners.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve introduced us to former heads in the automotive industry, he said, noting that one was a previous president of a major truck manufacturer. &#8220;We&#8217;re a technology company, but we also have trucking operations within our company and those kind of connections are incredibly valuable to us.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Ibex Investors founder and CEO Justin Borus looks at the transportation industry \u2014 and the technological changes that are coming \u2014 he sees one of the biggest opportunities in a lifetime.

Instead, they connect their products and inventory to retailers using Convictional\u2019s guided workflow and one-click integration.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273498\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>This way, retailers can more easily discover and change out inventory. It also enables their retailer customers, like Indigo and Harry Rosen, to get going in as little as 10 days versus three months. Moving that fast means retailers can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.convictional.com\/blog\/freshness-and-differentiation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identify emerging brands<\/a> before they wind up on big-box store shelves, Grouchy said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost enterprise retailers onboard third partner vendors for drop-ship and could maybe only onboard three suppliers each quarter,\u201d he added. \u201cWith Convictional, they can onboard 20 to 30 brands a quarter, which is a vastly different gross merchandise volume growth for businesses.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kirkness, who graduated from high school at 16, started his career at GNC, starting and running the company\u2019s e-commerce business. That was when he personally saw how difficult it was to connect GNC\u2019s software to a supplier \u2014 the company was sourcing from thousands of suppliers, but the connection process took so long that, at the time, they were only able to get fewer than 100 up-and-running.<\/p>\n<p>Convictional is not the only company finding success in this space.

They met each other at Shopify where they were in a group working on new markets, in this case, B2B, trying to figure out if what Shopify built would translate to that sector. That\u2019s how they learned that the struggle to connect with EDI was due to not having any APIs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAPIs are the hot style format for people learning computers in the web world,\u201d Kirkness said. \u201cWe thought about making an API for doing EDI, but when we talked to customers, they wanted a way to source, onboard, integrate and trade with suppliers all in one system.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So they designed Convictional so that suppliers can choose their own connection path of least resistance, API or EDI, he added.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lm1KNqHdJU\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/04\/4-trends-that-will-define-e-commerce-in-2022\/\">4 trends that will define e-commerce in 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;4 trends that will define e-commerce in 2022&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/04\/4-trends-that-will-define-e-commerce-in-2022\/embed\/#?secret=BZsoXN3ZRm#?secret=lm1KNqHdJU\" data-secret=\"lm1KNqHdJU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>There are two customer sides to the technology: the buyer side where retailers engage with consumers and look at brands, and the seller side, the manufacturing side, where suppliers need to upload product information, receive orders and share information to get paid.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, five months after announcing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/convictional-announces-6-7-million-series-a-funding-301383546.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$6.7 million in Series A<\/a> capital, the company Thursday secured $40 million in Series B funding, led by YC Continuity, with participation from existing major investors, including Lachy Groom, that led the Series A and an earlier seed round, and FundersClub. In total, the company has raised just under $49 million, Kirkness said.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of the Series A, Convictional had just closed its first enterprise deals, but had not activated them. Today, Kirkness and Grouchy say they also have activated five enterprise customers and are poised to add 20 more this year.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, more than 1,000 suppliers joined the platform in 2021, prompting usage to increase by 26% month over month and the number of orders to jump seven times compared with 2020. The company also increased its headcount by four times.<\/p>\n<p>The new funding will go into R&amp;D and its sales and marketing efforts for new customer acquisition. Kirkness and Grouchy filled the role of marketers and are now hiring across the board to replace themselves in key functions.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the investment, YCC\u2019s managing director Ali Rowghani is joining Convictional\u2019s board of directors. Rowghani said that he often looks for two characteristics in companies: virality and network effect, of which Convictional has both.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Roger and Chris a long time, and they are strong about their vision and passion, which is the profile of a company to put a shoulder behind,\u201d Rowghani said. \u201cIf they become a big company, a lot of people win \u2014 the

The good news is, in the context of history, periods of market correction are common \u2013\u2013 and great companies are still poised to thrive.<\/p>\n<p>In more favorable market conditions, using performance data to articulate a clear story about your company\u2019s potential is a best practice. But in the current volatile environment, using data to tell your story is imperative. Whether looking to raise equity or debt, investors pay even closer attention to a company\u2019s performance and projections in order to manage their own investment risk.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tGood news: in the context of history, periods of market correction are common, and great companies are still poised to thrive.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>As a former venture capitalist, I tell all founders that confidence in their data will have major implications on their company\u2019s valuation and deal terms when raising capital.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many companies lack an efficient way to gather, synthesize and interpret data into real-time insights, resulting in the default reliance on static, Excel-based samplings that may not capture the full picture of your company\u2019s potential.<\/p>\n<p>With all this friction, it can be challenging for entrepreneurs to even know where to begin. For founders and startup teams looking to become more data-driven in their approach to fundraising, the following steps are a good place to start.<\/p>\n<h2>Start with revenue cohort analysis<\/h2>\n<p>A cohort analysis looks at different groups of customers, whether that be users over certain periods of time or segmented by region or size, and allows investors to see how they individually perform. Investors love to see into the future because they know that <a href=\"https:\/\/corporatefinanceinstitute.com\/resources\/knowledge\/valuation\/intrinsic-value-guide\/#:~:text=The%20intrinsic%20value%20of%20a,discounted%20at%20the%20appropriate%20discount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the value of a business is the present value of its future cash flows<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>By decomposing the drivers of revenue growth via cohort analysis, you can raise investors\u2019 confidence in your cash flow projections, resulting in a higher valuation or more favorable loan terms.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2273292\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2273292\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2273292 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png\" alt=\"Revenue cohort analysis, May 2019 - March 2022\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1127\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png?resize=150,88 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png?resize=300,176 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png?resize=768,451 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png?resize=680,399 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png?resize=1536,902 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/revenue-cohortmarket-uncertainty-blog-charts.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2273292\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Revenue cohort analysis, May 2019 to March 2022. <strong>Image Credits: Hum Capital<\/strong><span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Take the above graph as an example.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/salesforce.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Salesforce<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/aws.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS<\/a> media industry groups have come together in an attempt to simplify that process by offering a solution that combines an infrastructure solution from AWS and marketing and customer management tools from Salesforce.<\/p>\n<p>Christopher Dean, VP and GM of media entertainment and media cloud at Salesforce, says that his group falls under the industry cloud that Salesforce formed after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/salesforce-grabs-vlocity-for-1-33b-a-startup-with-1b-valuation\/\">it acquired Vlocity<\/a> for $1.3 billion in 2020. Vlocity had built several industry-specific verticals on top of Salesforce, including media and entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>As the company grew the media vertical, they saw an increasing need in the market for a direct-to-consumer media streaming solution. While Salesforce had the tools to drive subscriptions, upsell and market to the streaming customer, it lacked the infrastructure to run it, and that&#8217;s when they decided to connect <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/23\/salesforce-aws-announce-extended-partnership-with-further-two-way-integration\/\">with longtime partner AWS<\/a>.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2273470\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;When we looked at it, we knew we had this end-to-end subscriber lifecycle capability, which is about audience attraction, acquisition, engagement and retention, using all the Salesforce tools. But we didn&#8217;t have any of the media ingest, distribution and delivery that we needed to make this happen. So if you stick the two together &#8212; I call it the chocolate and peanut butter moment &#8212; it actually works really well together, and we have an end-to-end solution,&#8221; Dean said.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2273486\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2273486\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2273486\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Salesforce-AWS direct-to-consumer streaming media service illustrating what each company brings to the solution.\" width=\"680\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg 1862w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg?resize=150,72 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg?resize=300,144 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,370 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg?resize=680,327 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg?resize=1536,739 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-16-at-4.21.44-PM.jpg?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2273486\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Salesforce \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Eric Iverson, director of product at Amazon Studios, says that as AWS and Salesforce talked about it, a combined solution made a lot of sense. &#8220;It actually seemed like we had these two stacks that do a lot of things that are pretty [related].
